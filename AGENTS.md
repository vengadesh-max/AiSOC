## Learned User Preferences

- Always track progress locally (e.g. in a TODO/PROGRESS file) so work can be resumed after IDE crashes or restarts.
- Complete all planned tasks without stopping mid-way; work through the full list until done.
- Do not mention competitor names (Prophet Security, Torq) anywhere in code, comments, or docs — this is an open-source project.
- Before pushing to GitHub, ensure no secrets, API keys, tokens, or sensitive data are present in any public repo files.
- Host codebase on GitHub once fully built out; keep documentation in sync.
- Never edit plan files directly — implement the plan as specified without modifying the plan document itself.

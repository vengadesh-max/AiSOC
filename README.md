## What AiSOC is

AiSOC is a single self-hostable stack that ingests security events, correlates them, runs AI-driven investigation, and surfaces the result in a SOC console. The agent and the substrate are MIT-licensed, so you can read, fork, or replace either of them.

Three properties distinguish it from closed-source AI SOC vendors:

1. **Agent decisions are logged.** The Investigation Ledger stores the LLM prompt, the response, the evidence cited, and the downstream tool calls for every step of every run. Replays are available later.
2. **The substrate has a public eval harness in CI.** Five suites gate every PR targeting `main` / `develop`: a 200-incident synthetic dataset drawn from 55 distinct templates drives the MITRE-tactic, investigation-completeness, and response-quality gates (each reporting both a per-case mean and a per-template macro so a single broken template can't hide behind 199 working duplicates); a separately generated 1,000-alert noisy stream drives the alert-reduction gate; and a schema/coverage gate validates `synthetic_telemetry.jsonl` — the companion corpus of ~360 backing events across 14 log sources (Sysmon, Windows Security, M365 audit, Azure sign-in, CloudTrail, Linux auditd, journald, EDR, DNS, web access, Kubernetes audit, GitHub audit, VPN, DB audit) that connector and Sigma PRs can wire against. Alert reduction is a real measurement against the fixed alert stream; the three rubric-based suites are substrate self-consistency gates over deterministic templates. The [benchmark page](apps/docs/docs/benchmark.md) explains exactly which is which.
3. **It runs entirely on your infrastructure.** No callbacks to a vendor cloud and no data exfiltration for "model improvement."

The orchestrator is a ~600-line LangGraph in [`services/agents/`](services/agents/). It is small enough to read end-to-end, swap models in, and patch.

## What's new (last 48 hours)

A high-velocity wave of v1.5 console + v8.0 architectural + security changes landed on `main` over the last two days. `VERSION` is still `7.3.1`; everything below is captured under `[Unreleased]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and will tag with the v8.0 cut.

**Console workbenches (v1.5 PR-1 → PR-6)** — the SOC operator surface is now a workbench, not a list.
- **Global time-window selector + topbar context** — one selector at the top of the console drives every page (Alerts, Cases, Hunts, Funnel KPIs, Pipeline Health). Persists across reloads, deep-linkable as a URL param.
- **Tenant switcher + role badge** — MSSP operators flip tenants from the topbar; the role badge makes it impossible to confuse a `viewer` session with an `admin` session. New endpoint: `GET /api/v1/tenants/me/identity`.
- **Critical severity tier** — the severity ladder is now `info | low | medium | high | critical`. Vendor-native criticals (Azure 5-tier, GCP SCC, GitHub `critical`, ServiceNow priority 1, GuardDuty ≥ 8.0, AuditD identity-destruction, K8s `cluster-admin`, Tailscale tailnet lockdown) map straight through instead of being collapsed into `high`. Confidence (`alert.confidence`, 0–100, band `low|medium|high`) is now decoupled from severity and emitted by `services/fusion` `ConfidenceScorer`.
- **Operations funnel + pipeline health** — new `/metrics/funnel` and `/health/pipeline` endpoints feed the `FunnelKpiBar` (Detected → Triaged → Investigated → Resolved) and an Efficiency Report so SOC leads can answer "where are we losing time?" without a Grafana detour. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/funnel-kpis.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/funnel-kpis.md).
- **Investigation Rail (W6 / PR-4)** — `/alerts` is now a two-pane workbench with narrative, related entities (`pivotPath` deep links), 6-event mini-timeline, and structured recommended actions. Fusion writes a deterministic correlation narrative at fuse time. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/investigation-rail.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/investigation-rail.md).
- **Investigation Queue workbench (PR-5 / W7)** — `/queue` is the page a Tier-1 analyst lives on: server-anchored SLA countdowns, atomic claim semantics, one-click triage actions. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/queue.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/queue.md).
- **Rule Tuning workbench (PR-6 / W8)** — `/detection/tuning` ranks noisy rules by precision impact and ships one-click suppression + allow-list edits with full audit trail. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/rule-tuning.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/rule-tuning.md).
- **Zero-prerequisite installer** — `install.sh` / `install.ps1` now bootstrap from a clean machine (Docker, Compose, Node, pnpm, Python) with idempotency and a graduated `uninstall.sh`. Documented in [`apps/docs/docs/installation.md`](apps/docs/docs/installation.md), surfaced as **Path 0** in the [quickstart](apps/docs/docs/quickstart.md).

**v8.0 wave-1 (architectural foundation, PR [#125](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/125))** — the foundation for the v8.0 line.
- **Graph at ingest** — Neo4j entity graph (17 node labels, 14 edge types) written inline with Kafka consumption. Batched UNWIND upserts + fire-and-forget retry queue keep ingest latency budget intact. Schema doc: [`apps/docs/docs/architecture/graph-schema.md`](apps/docs/docs/architecture/graph-schema.md).
- **Four-agent rebrand** — `DetectAgent`, `TriageAgent`, `HuntAgent`, `RespondAgent` are now the public façade; back-compat aliases preserve existing imports. Funnel KPI doc: [`apps/docs/docs/console/funnel-kpis.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/funnel-kpis.md).
- **`/hunt` natural-language surface** — type a hypothesis in English, get ES|QL / SPL / KQL templates back, save and schedule the hunt. HuntAgent never writes raw queries. Saved hunts deep-link into the Investigation Rail via `pivotPath`.
- **Sixteen first-party connectors** — wave-1 (`tines`, `torq`, `falco`, `pagerduty`, `opsgenie`, `confluence_audit`) and wave-2 fixtures (`cloudflare_zt`, `sysdig`, `vault`, `snowflake`). Five severity tiers preserved end-to-end.
- **L0–L4 automation maturity model** — [`apps/docs/docs/concepts/automation-maturity.md`](apps/docs/docs/concepts/automation-maturity.md) plus the marketing surfaces. Ladder: L0 manual → L4 fully autonomous closure with human sign-off.
- **Public weekly benchmark scoreboard** — [`apps/docs/docs/benchmark-scoreboard.mdx`](apps/docs/docs/benchmark-scoreboard.mdx) reads `apps/docs/static/data/scoreboard.json`, refreshed weekly by `.github/workflows/wet-eval.yml`. Substrate rows are visually separated from wet-eval rows — substrate numbers can never be quoted as live agent performance.

**Security & correctness wave** — 12 critical/high CVE-class fixes shipped before the v8.0 cut. See [`apps/docs/docs/operations/security.md`](apps/docs/docs/operations/security.md) for the full inventory.
- Rule-engine `eval()` RCE eliminated — conditions are parsed to a whitelisted AST in [`services/api/app/services/rules_engine.py`](services/api/app/services/rules_engine.py) ([#116](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/116)).
- `/hunts` and `/cases` tenant isolation enforced at the **query layer** (`WHERE tenant_id = …`), not via RLS alone ([#117](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/117), [#118](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/118)).
- CORS lockdown — a shared `cors.py` is vendored byte-identical into every Python service and refuses to start with `*` + credentials in production ([#119](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/119)).
- Playbook SSRF guard — every outbound `http_request` / `notify` runs through [`services/agents/app/playbook/ssrf_guard.py`](services/agents/app/playbook/ssrf_guard.py) with a cloud-metadata block list ([#120](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/120)).
- Plugin-manager OCI install hardening — signed manifests verified against an allow-list, image digests pinned and re-verified on every load ([#121](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/121)).
- Audit-log integrity (H-4 + M-12) — `actor_ip` spoofing closed via the new `TRUSTED_PROXIES` allow-list, secrets stripped from `changes`, hash-chain tamper-proofing ([#122](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/122)).
- `/alerts/submit` abuse + replay hardening — payload caps (events / per-event bytes / total bytes), `Idempotency-Key` header, recursive `raw_event` redaction, timestamp clamping ([#123](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/123)).
- Pydantic v1 → v2 settings migration ([#124](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/124)), bounded `eval()` + playbook timeouts ([#126](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/126)), one-flag dev-mode (`AISOC_DEV_MODE` — supersedes `DEV_MODE` / `SKIP_AUTH` / `AISOC_DEMO_MODE`, [#127](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/127)), untrusted-enrichment sanitisation before LLM ([#128](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/128)).
- Python CodeQL alert count on `main` driven to zero ([#133](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/133), [#136](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/136), [#137](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/137)); enforced as a CI gate going forward.
- First community contribution merged: [#135](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/135) (UEBA env-var alignment, closes [#134](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/134)). Every UEBA variable accepts both unprefixed (`DATABASE_URL`) and legacy (`UEBA_DATABASE_URL`) forms; unprefixed wins.

**Stage 2 / Stage 3 platform additions** — landed alongside v8.0 wave-1.
- **Wazuh Indexer ingest connector** — polls `wazuh-alerts-*` over HTTPX, paginates time-windowed queries, retries on 5xx; collapses Wazuh severity into the AiSOC ladder. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/connectors/wazuh.md`](apps/docs/docs/connectors/wazuh.md). The connector registry now declares **52 first-party connectors**.
- **auditd `file_tail` connector + `aisoc.rules` profile** — replaces the host-agent dependency for Linux endpoint visibility; 4 new detections pivot on the bundled `aisoc_*` audit keys. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/connectors/auditd.md`](apps/docs/docs/connectors/auditd.md).
- **Live Actions dispatcher** — generic vendor/capability surface so plugins can register executors against the in-tree taxonomy (`isolate_host`, `disable_user`, `block_ip`, …) without forking. Unknown pairs return a typed `LiveActionResult(FAILED, "executor_not_found")` — never a 500. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/concepts/live-actions.md`](apps/docs/docs/concepts/live-actions.md).
- **Deterministic NL → ES|QL / KQL / SPL translator** — replaces the template fallback in `/nl_query` with an IR + grammar validator; 50-pair gold eval set scores 100% syntactic, 100% semantic. Air-gapped by default; optional `gpt-4o-mini` enhancement falls back deterministically.
- **STIX → MISP push** — every STIX 2.1 indicator/bundle published through `/api/v1/threatintel/stix/...` can now be mirrored into the configured MISP instance. Air-gap gated, with a `?push_to_misp=true` query param and a dry-run endpoint for air-gapped audits. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/integrations/misp-push.md`](apps/docs/docs/integrations/misp-push.md).
- **GCP Cloud Run + Cloud SQL Terraform skeleton** — serverless-first BYOC equivalent of the existing AWS module. One `terraform apply` stands AiSOC up on GCP with private-IP networking, Secret Manager, and Artifact Registry. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/deployment/gcp.md`](apps/docs/docs/deployment/gcp.md).
- **Blameless case post-mortem endpoint** — `GET /api/v1/cases/{case_id}/postmortem?format=json|html` produces a deterministic retrospective covering contributing factors, detection timing/gaps, response phases, blast radius, and action items. Analyst handles are explicitly redacted from the narrative. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/operations/case-reports.md`](apps/docs/docs/operations/case-reports.md).
- **Per-rule cross-fire FP gate** — `services/agents/tests/test_detection_fp_rate.py` replays every rule's `match_when` against every *other* rule's positive fixture; current corpus 816 native rules, worst FPR 0.49% (5% ceiling). Wired into `scripts/run_evals.py` as `suites.detection_fp_rate`.
- **Operator-facing documentation refresh** — new pages for [notifications](apps/docs/docs/operations/notifications.md), [plugin lifecycle](apps/docs/docs/plugins/lifecycle.md), and [credentials / vault rotation](apps/docs/docs/operations/credentials.md); v2.2 architecture diagram and the corrected **52-connector count** (now including Wazuh Indexer + auditd `file_tail`) rolled through every surface.

The full inventory (with file paths, env-var changes, and test counts) lives in the `[Unreleased]` section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## How AiSOC compares

| Capability | AiSOC | Wazuh | Splunk ES | Closed-source AI SOC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open-source license | MIT | GPL-2 | proprietary | proprietary |
| Self-hostable | yes | yes | enterprise-only | cloud-only |
| Autonomous AI investigation | LangGraph | no | partial (Splunk AI) | yes |
| Agent decision audit trail | public Investigation Ledger | n/a | n/a | not published |
| Public substrate eval harness | CI-gated, reproducible, with synthetic telemetry corpus + per-template macros | n/a | n/a | not published |
| Detection content | 800 native + 6,000+ imported (Sigma / Splunk / Chronicle / CAR) | 1,200+ rules | 1,000+ apps | curated |
| Plugin SDK | Python / TypeScript / Go | YAML rules only | apps | proprietary |
| Data residency | your infra | your infra | partial | vendor cloud |
| Pricing | $0 (self-host) | $0 (self-host) | per ingest GB | enterprise |

Closed-source AI SOC vendors ship working products. AiSOC's contribution is making the agent itself open, the per-step decision trail readable, and the substrate gated by a public eval harness on every PR targeting `main` / `develop`.

## Deploy in 60 seconds

Four frictionless paths to a running, seeded AiSOC instance with `INC-RT-001` (the LockBit 3.0 ransomware showcase) already mid-investigation when you land on it. Each path runs `alembic upgrade head` and `python -m app.scripts.seed_demo` as part of its lifecycle, so the seeded data is present without a manual step.

### 0. One-click installer — zero prerequisites

Don't have Docker, Node, pnpm, or even git installed? Use the bootstrap installer. It detects your OS, installs everything idempotently, clones the repo, and launches the demo.

```bash
# Linux + macOS (one-liner):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beenuar/AiSOC/main/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beenuar/AiSOC/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer covers Ubuntu/Debian (`apt`), Fedora/RHEL (`dnf`), Arch (`pacman`), openSUSE (`zypper`), Alpine (`apk`), macOS (`brew`), and Windows (`winget`). On Windows it also handles WSL2 enablement for Docker Desktop. Re-running is safe — every step is idempotent. To uninstall later, `./uninstall.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `.\uninstall.ps1` (Windows). See the [Quick install guide](docs/QUICK_INSTALL.md) for flags, troubleshooting, and what gets installed.

### 1. Render — one click, hosted

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC)

Render reads [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) at the repo root, provisions Postgres + Redis, and brings up the demo profile (api, agents, web, realtime). The `preDeployCommand` migrates and seeds, so the canonical `INC-RT-001` is present on first boot. Sleep-on-idle on the hobby tier; flip to standard instances for production. Demo runs deterministic-mode by default — no OpenAI/Anthropic key needed. See [`infra/render/README.md`](infra/render/README.md) for cost, scaling, and BYO-LLM details.

### 2. Docker Compose — one command, local

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC.git && cd AiSOC && pnpm aisoc:demo
```

Pulls prebuilt `ghcr.io/beenuar/*` images, brings up the slim demo profile (Postgres, Redis, Kafka, api, agents, realtime, web), runs the seeder as a one-shot container, and opens your browser at `/cases/INC-RT-001?tab=ledger` with `demo@tryaisoc.com` already auto-logged-in. Idempotent: re-running is a no-op against a seeded volume. Target on a clean Mac with a warm Docker daemon: clone-to-investigation in **~3.5 min warm / ~5 min cold**. Stop with `pnpm aisoc:demo:down`. See [One-shot demo](#one-shot-demo) for the timing breakdown and what you'll see on screen.

**Screencast path — `--quick` mode:** for a deterministic four-case demo that runs in under four minutes on a warm laptop (the path the [90-second screencast](apps/web/public/.demo-mp4-placeholder) records against), pass `--quick`:

```bash
pnpm aisoc:demo --quick  # 4 cases in 4 minutes
```

This seeds exactly four cases — `DEMO-001` (spear-phishing), `DEMO-002` (cloud takeover), `DEMO-003` (insider exfil), `DEMO-004` (ransomware) — with byte-stable UUIDs and timestamps, then lands the browser on `DEMO-004`. Re-running cleans the four cases and reseeds, so it doubles as a reset button. Run `pnpm aisoc:demo --help` for the full flag list.

### 3. Fly.io — one script, hosted, persistent

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC.git && cd AiSOC
./infra/fly/fly-demo-deploy.sh --provision  # first run: also creates Postgres + Upstash
./infra/fly/fly-demo-deploy.sh              # subsequent runs: deploys updates
```

Idempotent shell wrapper around `flyctl` that deploys four apps (api, agents, web, realtime) plus managed Postgres + Upstash Redis, wires the `*.internal` 6PN DNS between them, runs migrations + seeding as a `release_command`, and issues TLS certs for your domain. ~$14/mo at idle. **Time-to-first-investigation budget: <60s from the click**, since the seeder pre-warms a running investigation so the deeplink lands inside the TTFI budget regardless of cold-start. See [`infra/fly/README.md`](infra/fly/README.md) for DNS prerequisites and per-app sizing.

> **Production-grade install?** Skip the demo paths above and use [`infra/helm/`](infra/helm/) (Kubernetes) or [`infra/terraform/`](infra/terraform/) (AWS). Both bring up the full storage tier — ClickHouse, Kafka, OpenSearch, Neo4j, Qdrant — gated behind compose profiles in the demo paths above.

---

## Deployment options

Each target ships a tested config in [`infra/`](infra/):

| Platform | Status | Config | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fly.io | first-class | [`infra/fly/`](infra/fly/) | 4 apps, ~$14/mo. See [infra/fly/README.md](infra/fly/README.md). |
| Render | supported | [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) + [`infra/render/`](infra/render/) | Sleep-on-idle, hobbyist tier. One-click via blueprint button. |
| Railway | supported | [`infra/railway/railway.toml`](infra/railway/railway.toml) | PaaS, pay-as-you-go. |
| Coolify | supported | [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) | Self-hosted on your own VPS. See [infra/coolify/README.md](infra/coolify/README.md). |
| Kubernetes / Helm | first-class | [`infra/helm/`](infra/helm/) | `helm install aisoc ./infra/helm/aisoc` |
| AWS / Terraform | first-class | [`infra/terraform/`](infra/terraform/) | `cd infra/terraform && terraform apply` |

The Render, Railway, and Coolify configs deploy the lean demo profile: api, agents, web, realtime, Postgres, and Redis. ClickHouse, Kafka, OpenSearch, Neo4j, and Qdrant are gated behind compose profiles. For a production-grade install with the full storage tier, use Helm or Terraform.

## Use it from Claude, Cursor, or Cody

AiSOC ships an [MCP server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) so analysts can query alerts, run agent investigations, and replay every step the agent took without leaving the IDE or chat.

```bash
# Claude Desktop / Cursor / Continue / Cody
npx -y @aisoc/mcp install --host claude \
  --aisoc-url https://aisoc.your-company.com \
  --api-key  aisoc_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The server exposes 11 tools — discovery (`aisoc_list_alerts`, `aisoc_list_cases`, `aisoc_query_detections`), deep-dive (`aisoc_get_case`, `aisoc_get_investigation`), and the action/replay set (`aisoc_run_investigation`, `aisoc_replay_decision`, `aisoc_explain_step`) for walking the agent decision ledger step-by-step.

Full guide: [docs/integrations/mcp](apps/docs/docs/integrations/mcp.md). Source: [`services/mcp/`](services/mcp/). npm: `@aisoc/mcp`.

## What's in the box

AiSOC bundles the components a SOC normally pieces together from separate vendors:

- **Connect data sources in three clicks** — a 50-connector click-and-connect catalog spans EDR/XDR (CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender XDR, Palo Alto Cortex XDR, Cortex XSIAM, VMware Carbon Black, Trellix Helix, Trend Vision One), SIEM (Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, Elastic, Sumo Logic, Datadog Cloud SIEM, Google Chronicle, Rapid7 InsightIDR), cloud + CNAPP (AWS Security Hub, AWS GuardDuty, AWS CloudTrail, AWS VPC Flow Logs, Azure Activity, Azure Defender, GCP Cloud Audit, GCP SCC, Wiz, Lacework, Tenable, Prisma Cloud, Orca), identity (Okta, Microsoft Entra, Auth0, Duo Security, 1Password), SaaS (Microsoft 365 audit, Google Workspace, Cloudflare, Proofpoint, Mimecast, ServiceNow, Jira, Slack audit, Salesforce, Email inbox), VCS (GitHub, Snyk), endpoint fleet (osctrl, FleetDM for fleet-wide osquery), container + orchestration (Kubernetes audit logs via apiserver webhook or `audit.log` tail), and network (Tailscale, Zscaler, Cisco Umbrella). Each connector renders a schema-driven form, runs a live `Test connection` round-trip before save, encrypts every secret with the application-layer `CredentialVault` (Fernet AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256), and starts polling on a per-instance schedule. Walkthrough: [docs/connectors](apps/docs/docs/connectors/index.md). Threat model + key rotation: [docs/operations/credentials](apps/docs/docs/operations/credentials.md).
- **Own your endpoint telemetry** — first-party `aisoc-osquery-tls` FastAPI service (`services/osquery-tls/`) and `aisoc-direct` lightweight agent connector ship a self-hosted osquery TLS plugin, FleetDM-compatible config/log endpoints, and a direct-from-agent ingest path that bypasses third-party SaaS. Built-in **file integrity monitoring (FIM)** endpoint (`services/osquery-tls/app/api/v1/endpoints/fim.py`) ingests `file_events` and synthesizes alerts on writes to `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, sshd configs, sudoers, and Windows registry hives; bundled osquery packs cover incident response, OSquery-ATT&CK, and FIM out of the box. **16 native osquery detections** (`detections/endpoint/osquery-*.yaml`, IDs `det-endpoint-281..296`) cover credential access, persistence, lateral movement, defense evasion, and discovery — paired with positive/negative test fixtures (`detections/fixtures/osquery_*.json`) and CI-gated against the Detection Validation workflow. **Live-query playbook step** (`osquery_live_query`) lets responders push allowlisted distributed queries to single hosts or fleet-wide via osctrl/FleetDM with HMAC-signed ChatOps approval. **5 custom Go-based virtual tables** (`services/osquery-extensions/`) extend the agent with `aisoc_browser_extensions`, `aisoc_kernel_modules`, `aisoc_attck_persistence`, `aisoc_pending_actions`, and `aisoc_alert_cache` for richer endpoint visibility and bidirectional response. Walkthroughs: [docs/connectors/osctrl](apps/docs/docs/connectors/osctrl.md), [docs/connectors/fleetdm](apps/docs/docs/connectors/fleetdm.md).
- **Ingest** events from any connector into a Kafka spine.
- **Correlate** them in real time with deduplication, ML scoring, per-alert confidence scoring, and Sigma/YARA detection.
- **Roll up signal onto entities** — Risk-Based Alerting accumulates time-decayed risk points on the user, host, IP, and domain each alert touches, promotes them to entity-incidents at a tunable threshold, and surfaces an entity-centric queue in the alerts UI. Hits the published 2026 KPI bar of ≥ 50:1 alert-to-incident ratio (CI-gated in [`services/fusion/tests/test_entity_risk.py`](services/fusion/tests/test_entity_risk.py)).
- **Search across SIEMs** — Federated Search fans out a single query to connected Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, and Elastic instances, translating the query into each target's native dialect (SPL, KQL, ES|QL) via pluggable translators in [`services/connectors/app/federated/`](services/connectors/app/federated/).
- **Manage detections as code** — Detection-as-Code (DAC) provides a propose → review → eval-gate → promote lifecycle for detection rules. Every proposal carries an eval result from the harness; candidates that regress MITRE accuracy cannot be promoted. Endpoints in [`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/detection_proposals.py`](services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/detection_proposals.py).
- **Run hypothesis-driven hunts on a schedule** — Hunt-as-Code YAML definitions in [`hunts/`](hunts/) declare a hypothesis, MITRE ATT&CK tags, log sources, indicators, and a cron schedule. The hunt engine in [`services/agents/app/hunt/`](services/agents/app/hunt/) loads the corpus at startup, runs hunts on their schedule, and stores findings in the DB.
- **Track detection drift** — the Purple Team service takes ATT&CK coverage snapshots and diffs them over time, so you can see which techniques gained or lost coverage between releases. Implementation in [`services/purple-team/app/services/drift.py`](services/purple-team/app/services/drift.py).
- **Verify ChatOps actions** — HMAC-signed approval prompts are sent to Slack or Teams before high-impact SOAR actions execute, with a time-limited verification token. Implementation in [`services/actions/app/executors/chatops.py`](services/actions/app/executors/chatops.py).
- **Benchmark against adversary LLMs** — a deterministic attacker-LLM mutator generates adversary incidents to test detection resilience. Script: [`scripts/generate_adversary_incidents.py`](scripts/generate_adversary_incidents.py); eval: [`services/agents/tests/test_adversary_eval.py`](services/agents/tests/test_adversary_eval.py).
- **Enrich** every signal with threat intelligence from TAXII 2.1, MISP, OTX, and CISA KEV.
- **Reason** about attacks via a LangGraph multi-agent system grounded in MITRE ATT&CK.
- **Detect deviations** with UEBA — per-user behavioural baselines and Z-score anomaly scoring.
- **Trap adversaries** with HMAC-signed honeytokens (URLs, files, AWS credentials, emails).
- **Validate coverage** with automated Atomic Red Team and Caldera adversary emulation.
- **Respond** with blast-radius-aware SOAR actions, every step explainable.
- **Govern** with multi-tenant RLS, granular RBAC, immutable audit logs, and SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / NIST CSF / PCI-DSS / HIPAA / DORA evidence dashboards.
- **Manage at scale** with an MSSP parent-tenant console — onboard child tenants, delegate actions cross-tenant, and view rollup metrics in one pane.
- **Track assets** with an asset inventory that auto-correlates vulnerabilities to alerts and surfaces asset blast radius.
- **Detect insider threats** with user risk profiles, behavioural indicators, and peer-group deviation scoring.
- **Gate automation** through L0–L4 maturity tiers — each tier unlocks progressively more autonomous remediation, with per-action whitelist and full audit gate log.
- **Generate internal threat intelligence** — harvest IOCs from alert history, track threat actors and campaigns, subscribe to external STIX/TAXII feeds, all queryable via the REST API.
- **Assess cloud posture** with a built-in CSPM/KSPM engine that ingests findings, tracks drift between scan runs, and surfaces a per-provider summary with suppress/resolve workflows.
- **Correlate through identities** with a graph of users, devices, and service accounts; link alerts to identity nodes for blast-radius queries and attack-path reconstruction.
- **Automate board reporting** — schedule PDF/HTML executive summaries, store artefacts, and deliver via email or webhook.
- **Three-tier agent memory** — session (in-process LRU), working (Redis-backed, 24 h TTL), and institutional (PostgreSQL + pgvector, permanent). Agents carry context across tool calls, cases, and sessions; institutional knowledge survives restarts.
- **Autonomy guardrails** — per-action confidence thresholds (e.g. `block_ip ≥ 0.90`, `close_alert ≥ 0.60`) gate every autonomous decision. Tenant admins can tighten or loosen thresholds via API; all guard-rail decisions are logged.
- **Investigation cost telemetry** — every LLM call is tracked by model, prompt tokens, completion tokens, latency, and estimated USD cost. Aggregates are persisted per-run to `aisoc_run_costs` and surfaced in SOC dashboards.
- **SOC metrics dashboard** — live MTTD, MTTR, False Positive Rate, alert/case volumes (rolling 7 d), and ATT&CK technique heatmap. Backed by a real-time API endpoint and a polished React component.
- **Analyst-override feedback loop with retroactive re-disposition** — analysts correct AI verdicts (`true_positive`, `false_positive`, `benign`, `escalate`) in one click. Corrections persist on the alert, flow into `aisoc_institutional_memory` keyed by an alert signature (category + connector + primary MITRE technique), and adjust FPR metrics automatically. The API surfaces *retroactive candidates* — past alerts in the same tenant matching the same signature whose disposition would now flip — for one-click bulk re-disposition.
- **Natural-language detection authoring** — describe a threat in plain English; the API translates it to Sigma YAML, KQL (Microsoft Sentinel), SPL (Splunk), and ES|QL (Elastic) simultaneously. Falls back to curated templates when no LLM key is configured.
- **Closed-loop detection engineering** — when an alert is marked as a false positive, the agent drafts a Sigma rule fix using an LLM, then automatically creates a Detection-as-Code proposal routed through the same human-review DAC workflow. CI re-runs evals on approval; regression gates block regressions.
- **Natural-language query execution** — ask a security question in plain English (`POST /nl-query/execute`). The API translates it to ES|QL, SPL, and KQL; for Elasticsearch-backed tenants it executes the ES|QL query live and returns structured results, column metadata, and the query text for all three dialects.
- **Identity-centric investigation timeline** — build a chronological event timeline anchored to any user, device, service account, or IP (`POST /identity-timeline/build`). The timeline queries alerts and raw events, annotates each event with the relevant ATT&CK technique, computes an entity risk score, and returns a sorted, deduplicated event list for triage.
- **Cross-platform detection translation** — convert any detection rule bidirectionally between Sigma YAML, Splunk SPL, Microsoft Sentinel KQL, Elastic ES|QL, and Google Chronicle YARA-L2 / UDM Search (`POST /translation/translate`). An LLM handles complex logic; a regex fallback handles simple field-mapping rules with no external dependency.
- **Hypothesis-driven hunt workbench** — define a hunt hypothesis in natural language (`POST /hunts`); the API auto-generates ready-to-execute queries in ES|QL, SPL, and KQL; analysts record findings against any run and the workbench tracks open, completed, and inconclusive hunts.
- **Phishing triage workflow** — submit raw email text, URLs, attachments, or domain indicators (`POST /phishing/submit`); the LLM extracts IOCs, assigns a verdict (phishing / benign / spam / malware / unknown), maps to MITRE ATT&CK, and optionally links the submission to an existing case.
- **Knowledge-base + RAG** — ingest runbooks, policies, SOPs, and wikis (`POST /kb/ingest`); the API chunks and full-text indexes each document; analysts query with natural language (`POST /kb/query`) and receive the top matching chunks plus an LLM-synthesised answer with citation, backed by PostgreSQL FTS when no vector store is configured.

## Console tour

The console fuses the analyst's day-zero workflow into one surface:

- **Dashboard** — KPI tiles, trend chart, and a WebSocket-driven event ticker.
- **Alerts & Cases** — triage queues, status workflow, evidence timeline.
- **Investigation Ledger** — replayable, step-by-step record of every prompt, tool call, and rationale the agent emitted on a case.
- **Attack Graph** — Cytoscape + fcose layout over the Neo4j subgraph for a case.
- **MITRE Heatmap** — coverage tiles with per-tactic technique density.
- **Threat Hunting** — Sigma / KQL / YARA editor with on-demand hunts.
- **Detection Rules** — Monaco-powered rule builder with Sigma autocompletion.
- **Detection Catalog** — community Sigma rules with one-click tenant install.
- **Threat Intel** — IOC search, feed status, and STIX / MISP source health.
- **Marketplace** — plugins, playbooks, and detections, with ratings, badges, and category filters.
- **Playbooks** — community and private playbooks with SOAR automation.
- **UEBA** — behavioural anomaly feed and peer-group deviation chart.
- **Honeytokens** — create lures, view trigger log, copy lure URLs.
- **Purple Team** — ATT&CK heatmap, execution tracker, tabletop sessions.
- **Compliance** — SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / NIST CSF / PCI-DSS / HIPAA / DORA evidence.
- **SLA Dashboard** — MTTD, MTTR, MTTC metrics + breach alerts.
- **Audit Log** — immutable, paginated, tenant-scoped event history.
- **Benchmark** — public eval harness (alert-reduction measurement plus three substrate self-consistency gates), run in CI.
- **Investigation Chat** — multi-turn conversational copilot at `/investigate` for case-scoped follow-up Q&A.
- **Coverage Advisor** — MITRE ATT&CK coverage gap finder with prioritized rule recommendations.
- **Shifts** — outgoing/incoming analyst handoff dashboard with active cases and queued approvals.
- **EASM** — external attack surface inventory: assets, exposed services, certificate-expiry monitor.
- **Noise Tuning** — per-rule false-positive analytics and one-click tuning suggestions.
- **MSSP Dashboard** — multi-tenant executive rollup with cross-tenant KPIs and SLA posture.
- **Team Analytics** — analyst leaderboard, MTTR per analyst, disposition accuracy, shift load balance.
- **Settings → RBAC** — roles, permissions, and user-role assignments.
- **Ambient Copilot** — context-aware next-action suggestions on alert, case, rule, and playbook pages. Each suggestion runs the right tool with the right payload.
- **AI Copilot dock** — slide-over invoked with `⌘J` for any page.
- **Command palette** — global `⌘K` for navigation, quick actions, and Copilot.

### Responder PWA

A separate, installable PWA route at `/responder/*` for analysts who carry a pager:

- **Passkey login** — WebAuthn / FIDO2 platform authenticators only, no SMS fallback.
- **On-call view** — current responder per tenant, surfaced in alerts on the desktop console too.
- **Approvals queue** — long-lived approval requests for blast-radius-gated SOAR actions, signed off with a hardware-attested passkey.
- **Push notifications** — VAPID-signed Web Push delivered through `services/realtime`, following the on-call rotation.
- **Offline shell** — service worker + cached app shell so the responder surface keeps loading on a flaky carrier link.

See [`apps/web/src/app/(responder)/`](apps/web/src/app/(responder)/) and [`services/api/migrations/009_responder_pwa.sql`](services/api/migrations/009_responder_pwa.sql).

The marketing landing lives at `/` and the console at `/dashboard`. Both share the same brand tokens.

## Quick start

### One-shot demo

To see AiSOC investigate an in-flight ransomware case in your browser:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC.git
cd AiSOC
pnpm aisoc:demo
```

That single command:

1. Pulls prebuilt images from `ghcr.io/beenuar/*` (api, agents, web, realtime).
2. Brings up the slim demo profile — Postgres, Redis, Kafka, api, agents, realtime, web.
3. Runs the canonical-data seeder (`services/api/app/scripts/seed_demo.py`) as a one-shot container that exits when finished. The seeder is idempotent: re-running it is a no-op against an already-seeded volume.
4. Locates `INC-RT-001` — a LockBit 3.0 ransomware investigation that's mid-stream when you arrive (encryption is in progress, the agent is streaming decisions to the Investigation Ledger, an auto-isolation playbook is mid-DAG).
5. Opens your browser directly at `/cases/INC-RT-001?tab=ledger`, with the demo analyst (`demo@tryaisoc.com`) already auto-logged-in.

Target on a clean Mac with a warm Docker daemon: **clone-to-investigation in under 5 minutes**.

| Step | Time |
|---|---|
| `docker compose pull` (cold) | ~90s |
| `docker compose up` + healthchecks | ~60s |
| Seed canonical data (one-shot container) | ~30s |
| Kick off live investigation step | ~30s |
| Total | ~3.5 min warm / ~5 min cold |

What you'll see when the browser opens:

- **Investigation Ledger** — the agent's per-step prompt, response, evidence cited, and tool calls for `INC-RT-001`, replayable from any step.
- **Decision graph** — Cytoscape view of the LangGraph traversal that produced the verdict.
- **Playbook timeline** — the in-flight ransomware containment DAG, with completed and pending steps.
- **15 other seeded cases** — phishing, credential access, lateral movement, exfiltration, cloud takeover — across `INC-PH-*`, `INC-CR-*`, `INC-LM-*`, `INC-EX-*`, `INC-CL-*` series, all with populated alerts, IOCs, and ledger artifacts.

When you're done: `pnpm aisoc:demo:down` (stops containers and deletes the demo volumes).

#### Hosted, public-internet equivalent

The same stack ships a Cloudflare Tunnel template (see [Public demo on your own domain](#public-demo-on-your-own-domain)) and tested deployment configs for [Render](render.yaml) and [Fly.io](infra/fly/) — both wire `alembic upgrade head && python -m app.scripts.seed_demo` into the deploy lifecycle so the same `INC-RT-001` showcase is present after `render blueprint launch` or `fly deploy`.

The full development quick start with all services (UEBA, Honeytokens, Purple Team, ClickHouse, OpenSearch, Neo4j, Qdrant) is below.

### Public demo on your own domain

The same demo stack can be reached from the public internet without exposing
ports, opening firewall rules, or paying for a cloud VM. AiSOC ships a
Cloudflare Tunnel template plus a wrapper script that:

1. Brings up the slim demo profile via `pnpm aisoc:demo --no-open` (Postgres, Redis, Kafka, api, agents, realtime, web).
2. Creates a named `cloudflared` tunnel (or reuses one if it already exists).
3. Renders an ingress config from [`infra/cloudflare/config.yml.example`](infra/cloudflare/config.yml.example) into `~/.cloudflared/<tunnel-name>.yml`, after validating it with `cloudflared tunnel ingress validate`.
4. Adds DNS routes on your zone so the apex (`https://<your-domain>`) and the `api`, `ws`, `docs` subdomains all resolve to the tunnel.
5. Runs `cloudflared tunnel run` in the foreground (Ctrl+C exits cleanly; the local stack keeps running).

The result: a publicly reachable, fully self-hosted SOC console, served from
your laptop, accepting only traffic that came in through Cloudflare. No
inbound ports are opened on your router or firewall.

#### Prerequisites

- A domain whose DNS is managed by Cloudflare.
- The [`cloudflared`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/) CLI installed locally (`brew install cloudflared` on macOS).
- One of two auth methods (the script accepts either):
  - **(A) Origin-cert flow:** run `cloudflared tunnel login` once on this machine — it drops a `cert.pem` in `~/.cloudflared/` that authorises this host to manage tunnels and DNS records on the zone. The script will then create the tunnel, render the ingress config, and wire DNS automatically.
  - **(B) Tunnel-token flow ★:** create a tunnel in the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard (Networks → Tunnels → *Create a tunnel* → Cloudflared), configure the four public hostnames (apex/api/ws/docs → `localhost:3000/8000/8086/3001`), and copy the `--token ey…` value the dashboard hands you. No `cert.pem` required, no local DNS plumbing. Useful when the browser-based `cloudflared tunnel login` won't write a cert (corporate browsers, headless boxes, etc).

#### Run it

```bash
# (A) Origin-cert flow — script manages tunnel, ingress, and DNS:
pnpm demo:public                         # default: tryaisoc.com
DOMAIN=demo.example.com pnpm demo:public # any zone you control

# (B) Tunnel-token flow — dashboard owns the tunnel, ingress, and DNS:
export CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN='ey…'     # paste the token from the dashboard
pnpm demo:public                         # script auto-detects the token

# Already have the local stack running? Just bring the tunnel up:
pnpm demo:public:tunnel-only             # works for both auth modes

# Just provision the tunnel + DNS, but don't run cloudflared
# (origin-cert flow only — useful before `cloudflared service install`
# to leave it running 24/7):
SKIP_RUN=1 pnpm demo:public:setup
```

All env vars are forwarded to [`infra/cloudflare/tunnel.sh`](infra/cloudflare/tunnel.sh):
`DOMAIN` (apex, default `tryaisoc.com`), `TUNNEL_NAME` (default `aisoc-tryaisoc`,
ignored in token mode), `SUBDOMAINS` (default `"api ws docs"`, ignored in token
mode), `SKIP_DNS=1` (don't touch DNS records), `SKIP_RUN=1` (set up everything
but don't run the tunnel), and `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` (switch to flow B).
Run `bash scripts/demo-public.sh --help` to see the full set, or read
[`infra/cloudflare/README.md`](infra/cloudflare/README.md) for the topology
diagram and production-hardening notes (running `cloudflared` as a launchd /
systemd service, layering Cloudflare Access in front, etc).

#### Stop it

```bash
# Ctrl-C in the tunnel terminal stops cloudflared.
# Then bring the local stack down:
pnpm aisoc:demo:down
```

The `tryaisoc.com` instance linked at the top of this README is exactly that:
this script, running from a maintainer's machine. The tunnel infra is
upstream so anyone can do the same on their own domain.

### Full stack (development)

> **Heads-up — this is the developer-build path.**
> If you just want to *see* AiSOC investigate cases in your browser, use [`pnpm aisoc:demo`](#one-shot-demo) above instead — it pulls prebuilt images from `ghcr.io/beenuar/*` and is up in ~5 minutes.
> The full stack below builds **22 services from source** (Python, Go, Node, Next.js) and brings up a heavy datastore tier (Postgres, Redis, Kafka, ClickHouse, OpenSearch, Neo4j, Qdrant). Only use this path if you're hacking on the source.

#### Prerequisites

- **Docker 24+** with **Docker Compose v2** (built into Docker Desktop). Run `docker compose version` to confirm — Compose v1's `docker-compose` is not supported.
- **Docker resources**: at minimum **6 GB of RAM** and **20 GB of free disk** allocated to the Docker daemon. On Docker Desktop: *Settings → Resources*. The OpenSearch + ClickHouse + Neo4j + Kafka quartet alone reserves ~3.5 GB at idle; under-provisioning causes silent OOM-kills that surface as opaque "container exited" errors.
- **Node.js 20+** and **pnpm 8+** (`corepack enable` then `corepack prepare pnpm@8.15.1 --activate`).
- **Go 1.21+** and **Python 3.11+** are only required if you plan to run individual services *outside* the compose stack.
- A free **8 GB of disk** for the build cache and image layers, on top of the 20 GB allocated to Docker.

Run `pnpm aisoc:doctor` after cloning — it sanity-checks Docker, Compose v2, allocated RAM, and host port availability before you spend 10 minutes on a build that's destined to fail.

#### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC.git
cd AiSOC
cp .env.example .env
```

#### 2. Configure

```env
# AI providers (one required)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Optional enrichment
CYBLE_API_KEY=...
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=...
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=...
GREYNOISE_API_KEY=...
SHODAN_API_KEY=...

# Optional TAXII feeds
TAXII_FEEDS=https://cti-taxii.mitre.org/taxii/,enterprise-attack,,

# Optional SSO (SAML 2.0)
SAML_IDP_METADATA_URL=https://your-idp.example.com/metadata

# Optional SSO (OIDC)
OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL=https://your-idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=aisoc
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=...

# Optional Purple Team
CALDERA_URL=http://localhost:8888
CALDERA_API_KEY=...
ATOMIC_RED_TEAM_PATH=/opt/atomic-red-team/atomics
```

#### 3. Boot

```bash
# Optional: pre-flight check (Docker daemon, RAM, ports) before a long build
pnpm aisoc:doctor

# Build and start all 22 services. Cold first run: 10-20 min (build) + ~90s (warm-up).
# Subsequent runs reuse cached layers and start in ~90s.
docker compose up -d --build

# Watch services come up
docker compose ps
```

The first invocation on a clean checkout will pull ~5 GB of base images and compile every Python, Go, and Next.js service from source. Plan for **10-20 minutes** on a typical laptop. After that, layers are cached and `docker compose up -d` is roughly 90 seconds.

If the build aborts, check Docker Desktop *Settings → Resources* — under-provisioning RAM is the #1 cause of opaque failures, particularly for the Kafka, OpenSearch, ClickHouse, and Neo4j containers.

#### 4. Seed demo data

```bash
pnpm seed:demo            # generates cases, alerts, IOCs, attack paths, UEBA anomalies
```

#### 5. Verify

```bash
pnpm aisoc:doctor         # health check: ports, containers, demo data, API + WS
```

If any check fails, the doctor tells you exactly what to fix before logging in.

#### 5b. Run the public eval harness (optional)

```bash
# Run all five substrate eval suites against the bundled 200-incident
# dataset (55 distinct templates) and its companion synthetic_telemetry.jsonl
# corpus, then write a machine-readable report. The dataset size is fixed by
# services/agents/tests/eval_data/synthetic_incidents.json — there is no
# --count flag.
python scripts/run_evals.py --out eval_report.json

# Or run a single eval gate
pytest services/agents/tests/test_mitre_accuracy.py
pytest services/agents/tests/test_synthetic_telemetry.py   # schema + coverage gate

# Regenerate the dataset and the backing telemetry corpus from scratch
# (e.g. after adding a template). Both files are written deterministically
# from a seeded RNG.
python scripts/generate_eval_incidents.py
```

The harness writes `eval_report.json` and `eval_mitre_accuracy_report.json`, which the [public eval harness page](apps/docs/docs/benchmark.md) renders. Each scoring suite reports both a per-case mean and a per-template macro across the 55 templates — the macro is the regression signal that doesn't dilute when the dataset is enlarged. The same harness runs in CI on every PR targeting `main` / `develop` — see [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

The harness runs deterministic substrate code (extractors, fusion, templates, judges) against synthetic data — it does not call the live LLM agent. Three of the four scoring metrics are substrate self-consistency gates rather than agent accuracy scores; the synthetic-telemetry suite is a schema/coverage gate, not a score. The [benchmark page](apps/docs/docs/benchmark.md) documents what each suite measures and what it does not.

## Plugin and detection SDK

The CLI is published as a Python package. Install it with `pipx` (recommended) or `pip`:

```bash
pipx install aisoc-cli            # PyPI release
# or, from the monorepo:
pip install -e packages/aisoc-cli

# Scaffold a new plugin
aisoc scaffold plugin my-connector

# Validate a detection rule
aisoc validate detection ./detections/my-rule.yaml

# Publish to community registry (Ed25519 signed)
aisoc publish plugin ./my-connector --key ~/.aisoc/signing.key
```

SDKs:

- TypeScript — `packages/plugin-sdk-ts` (npm: `@aisoc/plugin-sdk`)
- Python — `packages/plugin-sdk-py` (PyPI: `aisoc-plugin-sdk`)
- Go — `packages/plugin-sdk-go` (module: `github.com/beenuar/aisoc/plugin-sdk-go`)

Detection authors can drop YAML rules directly into `detections/` and SOAR playbooks into `playbooks/`. CI validates them on every PR ([`scripts/validate_detections.py`](scripts/validate_detections.py), [`scripts/validate_playbooks.py`](scripts/validate_playbooks.py)) and [`scripts/build_marketplace.py`](scripts/build_marketplace.py) republishes [`marketplace/index.json`](marketplace/index.json) so the in-app Marketplace picks them up automatically.

## Roadmap

The public roadmap lives in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). All releases through **v7.3.1** have shipped, including:

- **v6.0 / v6.1** — Investigation Ledger, Ambient Copilot, Responder PWA, public eval harness, MCP server, one-shot demo, autonomous triage agents, investigation chat, coverage advisor, shifts, EASM, MSSP dashboard, STIX/TAXII publishing, automated compliance evidence, AI-generated incident reports.
- **v7.0** — v1.0 buyer-value plan (16 workstreams): SBOM/SLSA supply chain, threat-intel attribution, executive digest PDF, BYOK per-tenant LLM credentials, air-gap appliance, WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility, ChatOps, telemetry/analytics opt-in, one-click Render deploy.
- **v7.0.1 — v7.0.3** — Endpoint telemetry wave: `osctrl` and `FleetDM` connectors, `aisoc-osquery-tls` FastAPI service, `aisoc-direct` agent connector, 16 native osquery detections (`det-endpoint-281..296`), live-query playbook step, osquery packs + FIM pipeline, 5 custom osquery virtual tables; plus 42 CodeQL alert resolutions and the `ClientOnly`/font-preload hydration fixes.
- **v7.1.0** — Cloud Security Coverage Wave: documentation backfill for Wiz, AWS Security Hub, and Lacework; two new CNAPP connectors (Prisma Cloud, Orca); three native AWS connectors (GuardDuty, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs); dual-mode Kubernetes audit log connector (apiserver webhook + file_tail) with a new `k8s-audit` ingest template.
- **v7.3.0** — Founder-flow series (PR1–PR7): `docker-compose.dev.yml` alias, `.env.example` cleanup with a pre-filled `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY`, `scripts/run_evals.py --suite` CLI contract, `aisoc serve` / `aisoc db upgrade` / `aisoc mcp serve|install`, the `aisoc submit` CLI command + canonical `examples/alerts/lateral-movement.json` fixture, and the Path C founder-style CLI walkthrough in [`apps/docs/docs/quickstart.md`](apps/docs/docs/quickstart.md). The recorded "fresh-clone to first alert" demo now runs verbatim on `main`.
- **v7.3.1** — Smoke-test hotfix: idempotent migrations (`005_compliance.sql`, `025_connectors_click_and_connect.sql`, new `042_alerts_schema_drift_fix.sql` adding eleven missing `alerts` columns), and a new `POST /api/v1/alerts/submit` endpoint that synthesises an `Alert` row directly from a batch of OCSF events. `aisoc submit` now targets the new endpoint, so the web console at `/alerts` lights up immediately on a fresh clone without Kafka / Fusion in the loop.
- **v1.5 console workbench wave (PR-1 → PR-8, on `main`, not yet tagged)** — the SOC operator surface stops being a list of pages and becomes a workbench:
  - **PR-1: Global time-window selector + topbar context** — one selector at the top of the console drives every page; persists across reloads, deep-linkable via URL param.
  - **PR-2: Tenant switcher + role badge** — MSSP operators flip tenants from the topbar; the role badge makes it impossible to confuse a `viewer` session with an `admin` session. New endpoint: `GET /api/v1/tenants/me/identity`.
  - **PR-3: Critical severity tier** — the severity ladder is now `info | low | medium | high | critical`. Vendor-native criticals map straight through; confidence (`alert.confidence`, 0–100) is now decoupled from severity.
  - **PR-4 / W6: Investigation Rail** — `/alerts` is now a two-pane workbench with narrative, related entities (`pivotPath` deep links), 6-event mini-timeline, and structured recommended actions. Fusion writes a deterministic correlation narrative at fuse time. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/investigation-rail.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/investigation-rail.md).
  - **PR-5 / W7: Investigation Queue workbench** — `/queue` is the page a Tier-1 analyst lives on: server-anchored SLA countdowns, atomic claim semantics, one-click triage. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/queue.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/queue.md).
  - **PR-6 / W8: Rule Tuning workbench** — `/detection/tuning` ranks noisy rules by precision impact and ships one-click suppression + allow-list edits with full audit trail. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/rule-tuning.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/rule-tuning.md).
  - **PR-7: Operations funnel + pipeline health** — new `/metrics/funnel` and `/health/pipeline` endpoints feed the `FunnelKpiBar` (Detected → Triaged → Investigated → Resolved) and an Efficiency Report. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/funnel-kpis.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/funnel-kpis.md).
  - **PR-8: Zero-prerequisite installer** — `install.sh` / `install.ps1` bootstrap from a clean machine (Docker, Compose, Node, pnpm, Python) with idempotency and a graduated `uninstall.sh`. Surfaced as **Path 0** in [`apps/docs/docs/quickstart.md`](apps/docs/docs/quickstart.md).
- **Stage 2 / Stage 3 platform additions** — landed alongside v8.0 wave-1:
  - **Wazuh Indexer ingest connector** + auditd `file_tail` connector + `aisoc.rules` audit profile (replaces the host-agent dependency for Linux endpoint visibility). The connector registry now declares **52 first-party connectors**.
  - **Live Actions dispatcher** — generic vendor/capability surface; plugins register executors against the in-tree taxonomy (`isolate_host`, `disable_user`, `block_ip`, …) without forking. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/concepts/live-actions.md`](apps/docs/docs/concepts/live-actions.md).
  - **Deterministic NL → ES|QL / KQL / SPL translator** — replaces the template fallback in `/nl_query` with an IR + grammar validator; 50-pair gold eval set scores 100% syntactic, 100% semantic. Air-gapped by default; optional `gpt-4o-mini` enhancement falls back deterministically.
  - **STIX → MISP push** + air-gap dry-run endpoint. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/integrations/misp-push.md`](apps/docs/docs/integrations/misp-push.md).
  - **GCP Cloud Run + Cloud SQL Terraform skeleton** — serverless-first BYOC equivalent of the existing AWS module. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/deployment/gcp.md`](apps/docs/docs/deployment/gcp.md).
  - **Blameless case post-mortem endpoint** — `GET /api/v1/cases/{case_id}/postmortem?format=json|html`; analyst handles are redacted from the narrative. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/operations/case-reports.md`](apps/docs/docs/operations/case-reports.md).
  - **Per-rule cross-fire FP gate** — `services/agents/tests/test_detection_fp_rate.py` replays every rule's `match_when` against every *other* rule's positive fixture; 816 native rules, worst FPR 0.49% (5% ceiling).
- **v8.0 wave-1 (on `main`, not yet tagged)** — Architectural foundation for the v8.0 line, landed by [#125](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/125) plus the security and correctness wave that followed:
  - **Graph at ingest** — Neo4j v1.0 schema (17 node labels, 14 edge types), batched UNWIND upserts off the Kafka consumer, `security.graph_updates` topic, and OCSF extractors for AWS Security Hub / GitHub audit / Okta system log / Kubernetes audit (`services/ingest/internal/graph/`).
  - **Four-agent rebrand** — `DetectAgent`, `TriageAgent`, `HuntAgent`, `RespondAgent` are now the public façade in `services/agents/app/agents/`, with back-compat aliases so existing imports keep working.
  - **`/hunt` natural-language surface** — `apps/web/src/app/(app)/hunt/` plus `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/saved_hunts.py`. Type a hypothesis in English, get ES|QL / SPL / KQL templates back, save and schedule the hunt.
  - **Sixteen first-party connectors** — wave-1 (6 fully tested: tines, torq, falco, pagerduty, opsgenie, confluence_audit) and wave-2 (10 wip, of which cloudflare_zt / sysdig / vault / snowflake already have full fixtures + tests).
  - **L0–L4 automation maturity** — `apps/web/content/papers/l0-l4-automation-maturity.md` + PDF, plus the marketing surfaces (sovereign one-pager, three anchor blog posts, reference-customer template).
  - **Public weekly benchmark scoreboard** — `apps/docs/docs/benchmark-scoreboard.mdx` + `apps/docs/static/data/scoreboard.json`, fed by the weekly `wet-eval.yml` GitHub Action.
  - **Security wave** — 12 critical/high CVE-class fixes shipped before the v8.0 cut: rule-engine `eval()` RCE elimination ([#116](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/116)), `/hunts` and `/cases` tenant isolation ([#117](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/117), [#118](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/118)), CORS lockdown ([#119](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/119)), playbook SSRF guard ([#120](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/120)), plugin-manager OCI install hardening ([#121](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/121)), audit-log trust-boundary closures ([#122](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/122)), `/alerts/submit` abuse + replay hardening ([#123](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/123)), Pydantic v1 → v2 settings migration ([#124](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/124)), bounded eval + playbook timeouts ([#126](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/126)), dev-mode unification ([#127](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/127)), and untrusted-enrichment sanitisation before LLM ([#128](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/128)).
  - **Static-analysis hygiene** — Python CodeQL alert count on `main` driven to zero by [#133](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/133), [#136](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/136), and [#137](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/137); enforced as a CI gate going forward.
  - **First community contribution** — [#135](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/135) (UEBA service environment-variable alignment, closes [#134](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/134)). Every UEBA variable now accepts both unprefixed (`DATABASE_URL`) and legacy (`UEBA_DATABASE_URL`) forms; unprefixed wins. Documented in [Environment variables](apps/docs/docs/deployment/env-vars.md#ueba-service-servicesueba).

Next (**v8.0 wave-2** — checkpointed with `[~]` in `AISOC_V8_PROGRESS.md`):

- Versioned `:CONFIGURED_AS {ts}` config-snapshot writers for AWS / GitHub / Lacework / Okta (T1.2)
- `LLMInputContract` fail-closed validator coverage across every sub-agent (T2.3)
- Attack-chain ranking + timeline UI hardening (T3.3) and business-context YAML rule engine (T3.5)
- Effective-permissions resolvers for Azure / GCP / Okta / GWS (T3.2)
- ChatOps full coverage: Slack Block Kit approvals, Teams Adaptive Card mirror, signed email approval URLs (T3.6)
- Remaining wave-2 connectors hardened to wave-1 quality (sublime_security, abnormal_security, box, dropbox, oci, datadog)
- Mobile responder console (React Native), plugin marketplace v3, AI-generated threat intel briefings, embedded red-team scoring widget, SLA breach predictor, SOC-in-a-box one-click cloud deploy

"""Saved-hunt scheduler — Track 3, T3.4 (`/hunt` NL surface).

Sweeps the ``aisoc_saved_hunts`` table on a tick and fires any saved hunt
whose cron schedule says it's due. "Firing" means re-translating the saved
NL question, executing the resulting ES|QL query against the configured
Elasticsearch backend, and (if the hit count exceeds zero) opening a case
so the duty analyst sees the result on the cases queue.

Why an in-process asyncio worker instead of APScheduler?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API service already runs two singleton ``asyncio.Task`` workers
(``oauth_refresh``, ``weekly_digest``) from the ``lifespan`` hook. They
share the same DB engine and shutdown semantics. Adding a third in the
same shape is the path of least surprise for operators — one process,
one log stream, one scaling unit. Pulling in APScheduler would give us
better cron semantics but would also introduce a new dependency that
makes deployment and graceful shutdown harder to reason about.

The trade-off: cron-string accuracy. We use a very small structural cron
parser (5 fields, ``* / , -``) and only support the common cadences. For
a v1 surface where 90% of saved hunts will be "every hour" or "every
6 hours" this is fine. If users start writing complex schedules we can
swap the parser without touching the call sites.

Disabling
~~~~~~~~~

Default-on, but flipped off in test environments and for operators who
run the API behind a separate scheduler service. Set
``AISOC_HUNT_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false`` to disable. ``main.py`` honours
the flag the same way it gates ``oauth_refresh`` and
``weekly_digest``.

# TODO(T3.4-followup): swap the bespoke cron parser for ``croniter``
# once the depedency is added in T3.5 (we'll already need it for
# scheduled report generation). The current parser uses ``last_run_at +
# fixed_interval_for_known_cadence`` which handles the documented set of
# cadences but is not a full POSIX cron implementation.

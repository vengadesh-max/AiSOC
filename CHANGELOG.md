# Changelog

All notable changes to AiSOC will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [7.0.3] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed — Hydration mismatch, font preload warnings

#### Web app (`apps/web/`)

- **`src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`**: Wrapped `<DemoBanner />` in a new
  `<ClientOnly>` boundary so the banner (which reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE`)
  is never server-rendered. This eliminates React hydration error #418 caused by
  stale env-var inlining producing a structural tree mismatch (server saw
  `<button>` from Sidebar, client expected `<div>` from DemoBanner).
- **`src/app/layout.tsx`**: Added `preload: false` to the `JetBrains_Mono`
  `next/font/google` config. The monospace font is only used in code blocks and
  is not needed on the initial paint of most pages, causing Chrome to log
  "preloaded but not used within a few seconds" warnings. Lazy-loading the font
  eliminates these warnings without any visible FOUT.

---

## [7.0.2] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed — Version alignment, landing-page footer, documentation

- **`apps/web/package.json`**: Bumped `version` to `7.0.2`; sidebar now shows `v7.0.2` dynamically.
- **`apps/web/src/components/landing/Footer.tsx`**: Replaced hard-coded `v6.1.0` string with a
  dynamic import of `package.json` so the landing page footer always reflects the current package version.
- **`README.md`**: Updated version badge to `7.0.1`; added `osquery-tls` (port 8090) and
  `osquery-extensions` entries to the services table, the Swagger-UI URL table, and the
  directory tree; added osquery TLS server URL to the dev surface table.

---

## [7.0.1] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed — Web app hardening: CodeQL, hydration, Turbopack config

#### Security (CodeQL Code-Scanning — 42 alerts cleared)

- **Python**: Resolved `py/unused-global-variable` in `credential_vault.py`,
  `pack_loader.py`, `executive_digest.py`, `case_summary.py`,
  `cost_dashboard.py`, and `actions/executors/base.py` by refactoring mutable
  state into dictionaries and exposing identifiers via `__all__`.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/cyclic-import` between `osquery-tls` modules by
  extracting `generate_node_key` into a new `app/core/crypto.py` module.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/empty-except` in `api/main.py` and `api/services/github.py`
  by replacing bare `pass` blocks with `logger.debug` calls.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/log-injection` in `github.py`, `detection_proposals.py`,
  and `llm_credentials.py` by switching log format specifiers to `%r`.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data` in
  `workers/oauth_refresh.py` by redacting `tenant_id` and sanitising reason strings.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization` in
  `llm_resolver.py` by using `urllib.parse.urlparse` for hostname extraction.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/stack-trace-exposure` in `agents/api/explain.py` by
  returning a generic error string from the exception handler.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/call/wrong-arguments` in `agents/tests/smoke_explain.py`
  by importing and passing a `LlmConfig` instance to `_stream_explanation`.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/unused-import` in `osquery-tls/db/env.py`; fixed
  `E402` (import ordering) in the same file.
- **JavaScript**: Resolved `js/unused-local-variable` in `AlertsView.tsx`
  (removed unused `toast` import) and `SettingsView.byok.test.tsx` (removed
  unused `within` import).

#### Web app (`apps/web/`)

- **`next.config.js`**: Removed deprecated `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds` key that
  Next.js 16 no longer accepts in the config file; added `turbopack.root` so
  Turbopack resolves workspace packages correctly.
- **`src/app/layout.tsx`**: Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to the `<html>`
  element so that the render-blocking `themeBootstrapScript` can freely write
  `data-theme`, `data-theme-preference`, and `style.colorScheme` on the client
  without React reporting a hydration mismatch on every page load.

## [7.0.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added — v1.0 Buyer-Value Plan: ChatOps, Digest PDF, BYOK, Air-gap, WCAG AA, Analytics

This release ships the complete v1.0 buyer-value plan across 16 workstreams.
All items were designed, implemented, tested, and reviewed by
Beenu Arora <beenu@cyble.com>.

#### WS-A1 — Slack ChatOps Bot (`services/slack-bot/`)

- **`services/slack-bot/`** — New standalone FastAPI service using `slack-bolt`
  async adapter. Ships `/aisoc triage <case_id>`, `/aisoc approve <action_id>`,
  `/aisoc status <case_id>`, and `/aisoc summary <case_id>` slash commands.
  Interactive approval buttons route back through the API approval endpoint so
  human-in-the-loop gates work from Slack without opening the console.
- 61 pytest cases cover the slash-command handlers, interactive payloads, API
  client calls, and error paths (bad token, non-200 API response, missing case).

#### WS-B1/B2 — Executive Digest PDF + Weekly Scheduler

- **`services/api/app/services/digest_pdf.py`** — Generates a branded A4 PDF
  for `ExecutiveDigest` objects using ReportLab. Includes cover page, KPI tiles,
  alert-volume chart, top-rule table, top-actor table, and remediation summary.
- **`services/api/app/workers/weekly_digest_task.py`** — APScheduler task that
  runs every Monday at 06:00 UTC, builds a digest for every active tenant, and
  delivers it via `POST /api/v1/reports/digest/email` or writes it to blob
  storage. Controlled by `DIGEST_SCHEDULE_ENABLED` env flag.
- **`services/api/app/services/digest_html.py`** — HTML mirror of the PDF for
  in-browser preview.
- **`services/api/tests/test_digest_pdf.py`** — 12 pytest cases covering PDF
  generation, chart rendering, and weekly scheduler triggering.

#### WS-C1/C2/C3 — Playbook Gallery, Detection Proposals, GitHub PR Integration

- **`apps/web/src/components/playbooks/PlaybooksGallery.tsx`** — Tabbed gallery
  with 12 curated packs (Phishing, Ransomware, BEC, IAM Key Compromise, …).
  Each card shows TTP coverage badges, author, version, and a one-click
  **Import** button that calls `POST /api/v1/playbooks/import`.
- **`services/api/migrations/039_detection_proposal_github_pr.sql`** —
  Adds `github_pr_url TEXT` and `github_pr_number INT` to `detection_proposals`.
- **`services/api/app/services/github.py`** — `GitHubService` creates draft PRs
  against the tenant's detection repo when a detection proposal is promoted.
  Supports GHES and github.com via `GITHUB_API_URL` env var.
- 25 playbook YAML templates added under `detections/playbooks/` and 12 pre-built
  playbook packs under `playbooks/packs/v1/`.

#### WS-D1 — BYOK Per-Tenant Settings UI

- **`apps/web/src/components/settings/SettingsView.tsx`** — New "AI / LLM"
  settings panel: provider picker (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama),
  API-key input, model selector, temperature slider, and connection test button.
- **`apps/web/src/components/settings/SettingsView.byok.test.tsx`** — 12 Vitest
  tests covering form rendering, provider switching, key masking, connection test
  success/error paths, and save confirmation.

#### WS-D2 — Investigation Timeline (Replayable)

- **`apps/web/src/components/copilot/InvestigationTimeline.tsx`** — 684-line
  React component that renders the investigation ledger as a playable timeline.
  Each step shows the agent name, tool call, rationale, duration, and status
  badge. A scrubber lets analysts replay from any step.

#### WS-D3 — Case Auto-Summary + PDF Export

- **`services/api/app/services/case_summary.py`** — LLM-powered case summariser
  (structured output via function-calling). Produces `CaseSummaryResult` with
  `headline`, `severity_rationale`, `recommended_action`, and `evidence_links`.
- **`services/api/app/services/case_summary_html.py`** — HTML renderer for the
  summary, used by the PDF exporter and the in-browser case card.

#### WS-F1 — Light Theme Persisted in User Profile

- **`apps/web/src/components/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`** — Theme preference
  (`light` | `dark` | `system`) stored in `localStorage` and synced to
  `PATCH /api/v1/users/me/preferences`. Survives logout and device switch.

#### WS-F2 — WCAG AA Accessibility (axe-core CI gate)

- **`apps/web/src/test/a11y.test.tsx`** — 55-line axe-core test suite. Renders
  `AlertsView`, `CasesView`, `PlaybooksView`, `DashboardView`, and 3 modal
  components; fails the build if any WCAG 2.1 AA violation is found.
- Sidebar landmark roles, ARIA labels, focus trapping in modals, skip-navigation
  link, and colour-contrast fixes applied across the entire component tree.

#### WS-F3 — Saved Views + Drag-Drop Dashboard Widgets

- **`apps/web/src/components/dashboard/DashboardView.tsx`** — Dashboard is now
  fully composable: widgets can be dragged, dropped, resized, pinned, and
  removed. Layout serialised to `POST /api/v1/saved-views`.
- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/saved_views.py`** — CRUD for per-user
  saved views (dashboard layout, column configs, active filters).

#### WS-G1/G2 — Threat Actor Attribution Engine v0 + Air-Gap Mode

- **`services/threatintel/app/actors/attribution.py`** — New
  `ThreatActorAttributionEngine` scores observed IOCs, MITRE ATT&CK
  techniques, tools, and target sectors against an in-memory catalog of
  three seed actor profiles (APT28, APT29, Lazarus). Scoring is the
  weighted sum of TTP (0.4) / Tool (0.3) / Target (0.2) / IOC (0.1)
  components, multiplied by the actor profile's baseline confidence,
  then thresholded.
- **`services/threatintel/app/api/actor_attribution.py`** — New router
  mounted at `/api/v1/actors` with `POST /attribute`, `GET /profiles`,
  and `GET /profiles/{actor_id}`. Constructs the engine once via
  FastAPI lifespan and passes it through `Depends(get_attribution_engine)`.
- **`services/agents/app/agents/investigation_agent.py`** — Investigation
  agent now calls `POST /actors/attribute` and surfaces attribution results
  in the investigation ledger.
- **`docker-compose.airgap.yml`** — Compose override for fully disconnected
  deployments: disables all external feed pullers, enables Ollama sidecar, and
  sets `AIRGAP_MODE=true` so the API switches to local-only LLM routing.
- **`apps/docs/docs/operations/air-gapped.md`** — Step-by-step air-gap
  deployment guide: image pre-pulling, Ollama model loading, threat-feed
  pre-seeding, and smoke-test checklist.

#### WS-H1 — MSSP Console Improvements

- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/mssp.py`** — New `GET /mssp/tenants`
  aggregation endpoint: per-child tenant alert counts, open case counts, SLA
  breach rate, and last-seen connector heartbeat.
- **`services/api/app/models/tenant.py`** — Added `parent_tenant_id` and
  `mssp_role` columns supporting the parent-child tenant hierarchy.

#### WS-H2 — BYOK Per-Tenant LLM Credentials

- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/llm_credentials.py`** — CRUD for per-tenant
  LLM credential records. Secrets encrypted at rest via `CredentialVault`.
- LLM routing layer (`services/api/app/core/config.py`) reads per-tenant
  credentials before falling back to the platform-wide key.

#### WS-H3 — Team Analytics View

- **`apps/web/src/components/analytics/TeamAnalyticsView.tsx`** — Analyst
  leaderboard with MTTR per analyst, alert disposition accuracy, cases closed
  per shift, and false-positive rate trend over the selected window.

#### WS-H4 — Air-Gapped / Ollama Local-LLM Mode

- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/llm_status.py`** — Reports whether the
  deployment is running in air-gap mode and which local models are available
  via the Ollama sidecar. Used by the settings UI to auto-populate the model
  picker.

### Fixed

- Ruff `E501/W291/W293/B007/B017/F821/I001` violations in `services/api`.
- `mypy` errors across all 16 plan-modified files: `RowMapping` import,
  `Optional` list `len()`, `current_user.user_id` rename, `fetchone()` None
  checks, `sort_key` return type, `PYTHONPATH` subprocess handling.
- Converted structlog-style `logger.info(key=value)` calls to stdlib formatting
  in `rule_engine.py`, `neo4j.py`, and `digest_pdf.py`.
- SQLAlchemy relationship `name-defined` mypy errors suppressed with
  `# type: ignore[name-defined]` in `tenant.py` and `connector.py`.

### Security caveat

The `/api/v1/actors/*` endpoints are reachable on the `threatintel`
service without RBAC enforcement in v0 — they assume cluster-internal
network reachability only. Do **not** expose them through public
ingress until a `Depends(require_permission(...))` guard is added.
Tracked as a known limitation in the docs.

---

### Added — Threat Actor Attribution Engine (v0)

- **`services/threatintel/app/actors/attribution.py`** — New
  `ThreatActorAttributionEngine` scores observed IOCs, MITRE ATT&CK
  techniques, tools, and target sectors against an in-memory catalog of
  three seed actor profiles (APT28, APT29, Lazarus). Scoring is the
  weighted sum of TTP (0.4) / Tool (0.3) / Target (0.2) / IOC (0.1)
  components, multiplied by the actor profile's baseline confidence,
  then thresholded.
- **`services/threatintel/app/api/actor_attribution.py`** — New router
  mounted at `/api/v1/actors` with `POST /attribute`, `GET /profiles`,
  and `GET /profiles/{actor_id}`. Constructs the engine once via
  FastAPI lifespan and passes it through `Depends(get_attribution_engine)`.
- **`services/agents/app/agents/investigation_agent.py`** — Investigation
  agent now calls the attribution API after triage/enrichment and
  records the result on `state.threat_intel["attribution"]`. Failure is
  soft and surfaces a `[medium]` finding rather than aborting the
  investigation.
- **`docs/threat-actor-attribution.md`** — Full operator-facing docs,
  including scoring model, API surface, observability, env vars, v0
  caveats, and instructions for adding custom profiles.

### Configuration

- `AISOC_ATTRIBUTION_THRESHOLD` — Override the default confidence
  threshold (`0.30`). Clamped to `[0.0, 1.0]`; invalid values fall back
  to the default and emit a warning.
- `AISOC_THREATINTEL_URL` — Base URL the agent uses to reach the
  `threatintel` service. Default: `http://threatintel:8083`.
- `AISOC_ATTRIBUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` — HTTP timeout the agent uses for
  attribution calls. Default: `10`.

### Observability

- New Prometheus series exported by `threatintel`:
  - `threatintel_attribution_requests_total{result="matched|unknown|error"}`
  - `threatintel_attribution_score{actor_id}` (histogram)

### Engine internals

- Tool matching uses an alphanumeric-only boundary regex
  (`(?<![a-zA-Z0-9])tool(?![a-zA-Z0-9])`) instead of Python's `\b`.
  Python's `\b` treats `_` as a word character, which broke common
  malware-filename patterns like `miniduke_v3.dll`. The new boundary
  treats `_`, `-`, `.`, and `/` as delimiters while still rejecting
  alphanumeric neighbours (so `x-agent` does not match `x-agentic`).
- Tool matching now also scans the IOC's `description` and `tags`
  fields, not just `value`.
- IOC lookups go through a new public method `OpenSearchStore.match_ioc_values()`
  rather than reaching into `os_store._os.search()` directly.
- The attribution engine accepts a `catalog` constructor argument so
  tests and downstream services can inject custom profiles without
  monkey-patching module-level state.
- An empty catalog now resolves to `actor_id="unknown"` with explicit
  reasoning (`"Actor catalog is empty"`), instead of confusingly
  falling through to the no-match-above-threshold branch.

### Security caveat

The `/api/v1/actors/*` endpoints are reachable on the `threatintel`
service without RBAC enforcement in v0 — they assume cluster-internal
network reachability only. Do **not** expose them through public
ingress until a `Depends(require_permission(...))` guard is added.
Tracked as a known limitation in the docs.

## [6.1.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added — v1.5 market-driven feature expansion

A review of G2, Gartner Peer Insights, and customer feedback on AI SOC / SIEM /
SOAR platforms drove this release. Five new agents, eight new console pages,
four new API surfaces, and ten new connectors landed at once. Connector catalog
goes from 16 → **26**.

#### New autonomous agents (`services/agents/app/agents/`)

- **`auto_triage_agent.py`** — Master triage agent classifies each incoming alert
  as `true_positive` / `false_positive` / `benign` with a confidence score.
  Low-confidence noise auto-closes; everything else escalates with rationale.
- **`phishing_agent.py`** — Specialised phishing triage: header analysis, URL
  reputation, attachment sandboxing summary, sender-domain trust.
- **`identity_agent.py`** — Identity-centric reasoning: impossible travel,
  privilege escalation, MFA bypass, and session-token anomaly classification.
- **`cloud_agent.py`** — Cloud posture / threat reasoning across AWS, Azure,
  GCP, and Kubernetes signals.
- **`insider_threat_agent.py`** — Behavioural deviation, peer-group scoring,
  exfiltration intent classification.
- All five are exposed via `POST /api/v1/agents/triage`.

#### New console pages (`apps/web/src/components/`)

- **`/investigate`** — Conversational, multi-turn copilot anchored on a case;
  reads its evidence, ledger, and entity graph for grounded follow-up Q&A.
  Component: `copilot/InvestigationChat.tsx`.
- **`/coverage-advisor`** — Ranks MITRE ATT&CK technique gaps by adversary
  prevalence and recommends rules to close them.
  Component: `coverage/CoverageAdvisorView.tsx`.
- **`/shifts`** — Outgoing/incoming analyst handoff dashboard: active cases,
  in-flight investigations, queued approvals on one screen.
  Component: `shifts/ShiftsView.tsx`.
- **`/easm`** — External Attack Surface Management: discovers public assets,
  exposed services, and certificate-expiry risks.
  Component: `easm/EASMView.tsx`.
- **`/mssp`** — MSSP executive dashboard: KPIs, cross-tenant alert volume, and
  per-customer SLA posture. Component: `mssp/MSSPDashboardView.tsx`.
- **`/noise-tuning`** — Per-rule false-positive rate, suppression candidates,
  one-click tuning. Component: `noise/NoiseTuningView.tsx`.
- **`/analytics/team`** — Analyst leaderboard, MTTR per analyst, dispositions
  accuracy, and shift workload balance.
  Component: `analytics/TeamAnalyticsView.tsx`.

#### New API surfaces (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/`)

- **`shifts.py`** — Shift-handoff CRUD: list active shifts, post handoff
  notes, view queued approvals scoped to a shift window.
- **`stix_taxii.py`** — STIX 2.1 / TAXII 2.1 publishing; pushes the tenant's
  IOCs and threat-actor profiles to upstream / community feeds.
- **`compliance.py`** — Automated compliance evidence collection for SOC 2,
  ISO 27001, NIST CSF, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and DORA. One-click evidence pull.
- **`deployment.py`** — Deployment / air-gap toggles; tenants that disallow
  external feeds can flip air-gap mode here.

#### New connectors (`services/connectors/app/connectors/`)

EDR / XDR: `sentinelone.py`, `cortex_xdr.py`. Cloud security: `wiz.py`,
`snyk.py`. Network: `zscaler.py`. SaaS / email: `proofpoint.py`,
`servicenow.py`, `jira.py`. Identity: `1password.py`, `duo_security.py`.
All ten registered in `services/connectors/app/connectors/__init__.py`,
all ship a marketplace manifest under `plugins/<id>/plugin.yaml`, all
collapse vendor severity to the standard four-tier ladder.

#### Other

- **AI-generated incident reports** — Every case now has a one-click "Export
  Report" button that generates a PDF incident report from the Investigation
  Ledger.
- **Air-gap deployment configuration** — Per-tenant toggles disable external
  feeds (threat intel, marketplace sync, push notifications) for fully
  air-gapped deployments.

### Changed

- Connector catalog count **16 → 26**. Landing page hero stat, layout SEO
  metadata, and `apps/docs/docs/connectors/index.md` updated to reflect.
- `apps/docs/docs/architecture.md` adds a v1.5 section and updates the
  service-responsibilities table to include the new API surfaces and
  autonomous agents.
- `apps/docs/docs/intro.md` updated to mention the new connector count and
  v1.5 features.
- Footer release link now points at `v6.1.0`.

## [6.0.1] — 2026-05-06

### Security

- **Log-injection mitigation** (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/connectors.py`) —
  `connector_type` originates from user-supplied query parameters and was previously
  logged verbatim, leaving an injection path for newlines/control characters into
  structured log records. A character-allowlist reconstructor (`_safe_connector_type`)
  now strips every character outside `[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]` before the value reaches any
  log call, breaking CodeQL's taint trace (alert `py/log-injection`).

- **Remove dead rate-limiter code** (`services/realtime/src/index.ts`) —
  The hand-rolled `makeRateLimiter` function was superseded by `express-rate-limit`
  in the previous release but not removed, leaving dead code that masked the
  effective rate-limiting path. The function is now deleted; `express-rate-limit`
  is the sole limiter in production (resolves CodeQL alert `js/unused-local-variable`).

## [6.0.0] — 2026-05-06

### Added

#### Wave 3 — Operational Maturity

- **MSSP / parent-tenant console** (`services/api/migrations/012_mssp_console.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/mssp.py`, `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/mssp.py`) —
  Parent tenants can onboard child tenants, manage cross-tenant delegations, add
  per-tenant notes, and view an aggregated metrics rollup in a single pane.

- **Asset inventory + vuln-to-alert correlation** (`services/api/migrations/013_asset_inventory.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/asset.py`, `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/assets.py`) —
  CRUD for discovered assets with vulnerability findings auto-correlated to alerts.
  Surfaces asset blast radius and enables asset-context enrichment during triage.

- **Insider threat module** (`services/api/migrations/014_insider_threat.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/insider_threat.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/insider_threat.py`) —
  User risk profiles, behavioural indicators, peer-group deviation scoring, and
  watchlist management. Risk scores update incrementally as new indicators arrive.

- **L0–L4 auto-remediation maturity tiers** (`services/api/migrations/015_remediation_maturity.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/remediation.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/remediation.py`,
  `services/actions/app/services/maturity.py`) —
  Per-tenant configuration of remediation autonomy from L0 (manual only) through L4
  (fully autonomous). Gate log records every approve/block decision. Per-action whitelist
  pre-approves low-risk actions regardless of tier.

#### Wave 4 — Advanced Capabilities

- **Internal threat intelligence** (`services/api/migrations/016_threat_intel.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/threat_intel.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/threat_intel.py`) —
  IOC harvesting from alert history, threat actor and campaign profiles, and STIX/TAXII
  feed subscription management, all queryable via the REST API.

- **Cloud security posture management (CSPM/KSPM)** (`services/api/migrations/017_cspm.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/posture.py`, `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/posture.py`) —
  Ingests posture findings from cloud providers, tracks drift between scan runs, and
  surfaces a per-provider posture summary with suppress/resolve workflows.

- **Identity-centric correlation graph** (`services/api/migrations/018_identity_graph.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/identity_graph.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/identity_graph.py`) —
  Graph of users, devices, service accounts, and roles with typed relationship edges.
  Alerts link to identity nodes, enabling blast-radius queries and attack-path
  reconstruction.

- **Auto-generated board reports** (`services/api/migrations/019_board_reports.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/report.py`, `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/reports.py`) —
  Report templates and scheduled generation of PDF/HTML executive summaries. Artefacts
  are stored, versioned, and deliverable via email or webhook.

#### Platform

- **Dashboard metrics API** (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/metrics.py`) —
  `/api/v1/metrics/dashboard` aggregates alert KPIs, case counts, connector source
  stats, top MITRE tactics, 24-hour alert trend, and threats-by-source for the
  frontend dashboard tiles. `/api/v1/metrics/alerts/trend` supports `1h / 24h / 7d / 30d`
  period buckets.

- **Tailscale connector** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/tailscale.py`) —
  Pulls audit logs and policy-file change events from the Tailscale API with
  OAuth client-credential and API-key auth, cursor-based pagination, and four-tier
  severity mapping.

- **AWS GuardDuty credential-exfiltration detection** (`detections/cloud/aws-guardduty-instance-credential-exfiltration.yaml`) —
  Sigma rule covering EC2 instance credential exfiltration via `UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration`.

---

### Click-and-connect cloud connector platform

This pass turns connectors from a hardcoded, code-edit-only feature into a
runtime, schema-driven, click-and-connect surface — and lights up nine new
cloud / SaaS / VCS sources (Microsoft Entra, Azure Activity, Defender XDR,
GCP Cloud Audit, GCP SCC, Microsoft 365 audit, Google Workspace, Cloudflare,
GitHub) on top of the original CrowdStrike / Splunk / AWS Security Hub /
Okta / Microsoft Sentinel set.

#### Added

- **`CredentialVault`** (`services/api/app/security/credential_vault.py`,
  `services/connectors/app/security/credential_vault.py`) — Fernet
  (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) wrapper for `auth_config` JSON, keyed off the
  new `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY` env var. Supports `MultiFernet` rotation via
  `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY_ROTATION_FROM`. The `services/connectors`
  read-path mirror decrypts only; writes always go through the API
  service. Documented in [docs/operations/credentials](apps/docs/docs/operations/credentials.md).
- **Self-describing connector schemas** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/base.py`)
  — `BaseConnector` gained a `Field` / `OAuthHints` / `ConnectorSchema`
  trio and an abstract `schema()` classmethod. Each connector class is now
  the source of truth for its own `name`, `connector_category`, fields
  (text / secret / select / textarea / oauth), default poll interval, and
  hosted-OAuth roadmap hints. The hardcoded dict in
  `services/connectors/app/api/router.py` is gone — schema responses come
  from the registry built in `services/connectors/app/connectors/__init__.py`.
- **`/api/v1/connectors` CRUD endpoints**
  (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/connectors.py`,
  `services/api/app/schemas/connector.py`) — `GET /catalog`, `POST /test`,
  `GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE /instances`, `POST /instances/{id}/test`.
  Tenant-scoped via the existing auth dependency, secrets encrypted on
  write through the vault, and proxied to the connectors microservice for
  schema lookups and live `Test connection` calls.
- **`ConnectorScheduler`** (`services/connectors/app/scheduler.py`) —
  APScheduler in-process inside `services/connectors`, started in the
  FastAPI lifespan. One job per enabled instance, polls
  `fetch_alerts(since_seconds=300)` every 5 min by default
  (`connector_config.poll_interval_seconds` overrides per instance),
  decrypts via the read-path vault, normalizes events through the
  connector's `normalize()` method, and pushes the batch to
  `services/ingest/v1/ingest/batch` via the new `IngestClient`. Set
  `AISOC_CONNECTORS_DISABLE_SCHEDULER=1` to skip wiring the scheduler in
  tests.
- **Nine new connectors** in `services/connectors/app/connectors/`:
  `azure_entra` (Microsoft Graph audit logs), `azure_activity` (ARM
  Activity Log via Resource Graph + blast-radius `_HIGH_BLAST_RADIUS_VERBS`
  list), `azure_defender` (Microsoft Graph Security alerts),
  `gcp_cloud_audit` (Cloud Logging API with hand-rolled RS256 JWT
  signing for service-account auth), `gcp_scc` (Security Command Center
  findings, same JWT signer), `m365_audit` (Office 365 Management
  Activity API, sharing the Azure AD app from `azure_entra`),
  `google_workspace` (Reports API with domain-wide delegation),
  `cloudflare` (Audit Logs), and `github` (Org Audit Log + Code Scanning
  alerts). Every connector ships unit tests covering schema contract,
  normalization, and `test_connection()` happy/sad paths
  (`services/connectors/tests/test_*_connectors.py`,
  `test_schemas.py`, `test_scheduler.py`).
- **Frontend click-and-connect wizard**
  (`apps/web/src/components/connectors/AddConnectorModal.tsx`,
  `ConnectorInstanceList.tsx`, rewired
  `ConnectorsView.tsx`, typed client in `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`) —
  two-step modal: (1) catalog grid grouped by category, (2)
  schema-driven form with `text` / `secret` / `select` / `textarea`
  fields, an inline `Test connection` button, and a `Save & enable`
  action. `framer-motion` for transitions, `react-hot-toast` for
  feedback. Existing connector cards now render from the live API via
  SWR.
- **Marketplace + plugin manifests** —
  `plugins/{azure-entra, azure-activity, azure-defender, gcp-cloud-audit,
  gcp-scc, m365-audit, google-workspace, cloudflare, github}/plugin.yaml`
  carry the new `schema()` shape so `scripts/build_marketplace.py` can
  surface them in the in-app Marketplace, and
  `apps/web/public/marketplace/index.json` is regenerated via
  `pnpm marketplace:sync`.
- **Documentation** — `apps/docs/docs/connectors/index.md` (catalog
  landing with a connector walkthrough and category taxonomy), nine
  per-connector setup walkthroughs (prereqs, scopes, screenshots),
  `apps/docs/docs/operations/credentials.md` (vault threat model, key
  rotation procedure, hosted-OAuth roadmap), and a new `Connectors`
  section in `apps/docs/sidebars.ts`.

#### Changed

- **`services/api/app/core/config.py`** — added `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY`,
  `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY_ROTATION_FROM`, `CONNECTORS_SERVICE_URL`,
  `CONNECTORS_SERVICE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Documented in `.env.example`.
- **`services/api/app/main.py`** — the new `/api/v1/connectors` router is
  mounted alongside the existing v1 router set.
- **`services/connectors/app/api/router.py`** — schema responses lookup
  the registry instead of returning a hardcoded dict; new
  `POST /connectors/{connector_id}/test` endpoint runs an
  unauthenticated dry-run `test_connection()` for the wizard's
  pre-save Test step.
- **`services/connectors/app/main.py`** — the FastAPI lifespan now wires
  the scheduler, with `AISOC_CONNECTORS_DISABLE_SCHEDULER` honored for
  tests and CI.

#### Why this matters

Before this pass: adding a connector meant editing Python in three places,
shipping a release, and reading docs to discover the auth fields. Secrets
sat in plain JSON in Postgres. After this pass: connectors are runtime
data; secrets are encrypted with a key the operator controls; rotation
is a documented procedure; the wizard's `Test connection` round-trip
catches bad credentials before they're saved; and the per-connector docs
each give an analyst a 5-minute path from "I have a tenant" to "alerts
are flowing into the console."

---

### Eval harness v1.4 — synthetic telemetry + per-template macros

This pass addresses two questions raised on the public launch thread about
the v5.2 eval harness:

1. **"Any interest in shipping synthetic telemetry (M365 audit, CloudTrail,
   Sysmon) backing each incident?"** — Yes. A companion
   `synthetic_telemetry.jsonl` corpus is now generated alongside
   `synthetic_incidents.json` and gives connector and Sigma PRs a concrete
   contract to wire against without provisioning a real tenant.
2. **"INC-EVAL-044, 099, and 154 are the same template with `{user}/{host}`
   swapped — what does the multiplier buy vs. the dilution in regression
   signal?"** — The multiplier still buys breadth for connector regressions,
   but the eval suites now report a per-template macro alongside the
   per-case mean so a single broken template (~4 cases) moves the regression
   signal by ~1.8% rather than ~0.5%, and the failing template IDs are
   surfaced inline.

#### Added

- **Synthetic telemetry corpus**
  (`services/agents/tests/eval_data/synthetic_telemetry.jsonl`,
  `scripts/generate_eval_incidents.py`) — 361 backing events spanning 14
  log sources (Sysmon, Windows Security, M365 audit, Azure sign-in,
  CloudTrail, Linux auditd, journald, EDR, DNS, web access, Kubernetes
  audit, GitHub audit, VPN, DB audit), wired to all 200 incidents. Each
  event is a templated dictionary with `{user}/{host}/{ip}/{campaign}`
  placeholders resolved against the incident it backs, and carries the
  fields a real connector pivots on (process tree, principal, source IP,
  log source, event ID).
- **Telemetry event factories + recursive resolver**
  (`scripts/generate_eval_incidents.py`) — `_sysmon`, `_winsec`, `_m365`,
  `_azure_signin`, `_cloudtrail`, `_auditd`, `_journald`, `_edr`, `_dns`,
  `_web`, `_k8s`, `_github`, `_vpn`, `_db` produce base event shapes; a
  recursive resolver walks nested dicts and substitutes incident
  context. The 55 templates in `_TEMPLATES` each now carry a
  `template_id`, a `template_index`, and a tuple of telemetry events.
- **Schema + coverage gate** (`services/agents/tests/test_synthetic_telemetry.py`)
  — five new assertions: every incident has ≥ 1 backing event, every
  expected source is present, every event carries the source-specific
  pivot fields a real connector needs, all placeholders resolve, and no
  single template dominates the source distribution.
- **Per-template macros on every scoring suite**
  (`services/agents/tests/test_mitre_accuracy.py`,
  `test_investigation_completeness.py`, `test_response_quality.py`,
  `scripts/run_evals.py`) — each result now carries a
  `per_template_summary()` (mean, median, min, max, count, failing IDs)
  alongside the per-case mean, plus a new test gating macro accuracy ≥
  0.80 for MITRE / completeness and ≥ 0.75 for response-plan quality. A
  template-distribution-balance test asserts no single template accounts
  for > 5% of incidents (currently 0.5–2.0% each).
- **`run_evals.py` output expansion** — each suite headline now prints
  the per-case mean *and* the per-template macro with the failing
  template IDs inline; the human-readable summary appends a synthetic-
  telemetry footer (event count, source count, incident coverage, file
  path); `--json` output adds `per_template` and `telemetry` blocks.

#### Changed

- **Incident schema** — `synthetic_incidents.json` entries now include
  `template_id` (e.g. `m365_admin_impersonation`) and `template_index`
  fields. Existing fields are unchanged. Regenerated deterministically
  from the seeded RNG.
- **`apps/docs/docs/benchmark.md`** — added a "What's new (v1.4)"
  section, a "Per-case vs. per-template metrics" section explaining the
  ~0.5% vs ~1.8% sensitivity argument with worked examples, and a new
  "Synthetic telemetry corpus" section documenting the 14 sources, the
  pivot fields, the placeholder resolver, and the five schema/coverage
  checks. The "Help us harden the harness" call-outs now include adding
  a connector + Sigma rule against the corpus and adding a new template
  with backing telemetry. The "What this is not" section is updated to
  call out that the corpus is hand-shaped (not captured from a live
  tenant) and that the per-template macro is the non-tautological signal
  on top of the otherwise self-consistent gates.
- **`README.md`** — capability bullet rewritten to call out five suites
  (was four), 55 distinct templates, per-case + per-template macros, and
  the synthetic-telemetry coverage gate. The comparison table flags the
  eval harness as having a synthetic-telemetry corpus + per-template
  macros. Step 5b (`Run the public eval harness`) documents the new
  `python scripts/generate_eval_incidents.py` workflow for regenerating
  the dataset and the corpus together.
- **Eval signature on completeness + response-quality runs** — calls
  from `run_evals.py` now use `keep_per_incident=True` so the per-
  template summary is computable. Default behaviour unchanged for
  existing direct callers.

#### Why this matters

The v5.2 harness gave deterministic numbers but two real concerns existed:
duplicates could mask a broken template behind 199 working duplicates, and
there was no concrete telemetry shape for connector contributors to wire
against. v1.4 closes both: the per-template macro is the dilution-resistant
regression signal that surfaces template-class breaks, and the synthetic
telemetry corpus is the connector-development contract.

---

### Honesty + scale pass (P0–P4 of the post-gimmick improvement plan)

This is a "fix the foundations" pass: tighten security defaults, drop
overclaims, harden CI, fix DX rough edges, scale detection content from
~200 to 6,913 rules with explicit tiering, and ship a public demo
hosted on `tryaisoc.com` via Cloudflare Tunnel.

#### Security defaults (P0)

- **GraphQL tenant scoping** (`services/api/app/graphql/`) — every
  resolver is wrapped with a `tenant_scope` helper, GraphiQL is forced
  off in production, and a tenant-isolation regression test asserts
  cross-tenant reads return 0 rows.
- **Plugin signature gate** (`services/api/app/services/plugin_manager.py`,
  `packages/plugin-sdk-py/src/aisoc_plugin_sdk/loader.py`,
  `packages/plugin-sdk-go/aisoc/loader.go`) — Ed25519 signature
  verification is required before loading any plugin. `PLUGIN_TRUST_MODE`
  controls policy: `strict` (default, signed only), `permissive` (warn
  + load), `dev` (skip). Publisher signing flow is documented in
  `packages/plugin-sdk-py/README.md` and `packages/plugin-sdk-go/README.md`.
- **`/metrics` and compose hardening** (`docker-compose.yml`,
  `docker-compose.demo.yml`, `services/api/app/main.py`,
  `services/api/app/core/security.py`) — service ports bind to
  `127.0.0.1` by default, the API logs a loud warning if `SECRET_KEY`
  is unset or default, the `admin` role permissions are corrected to
  match the documented matrix, and `/metrics` is gated behind
  `METRICS_TOKEN`.

#### Honesty surface (P1)

- **Fusion pipeline framing** (`services/agents/app/fusion/`,
  `apps/docs/docs/architecture.md`) — replaced "real fusion pipeline"
  with the actual scope (rule-based + ML scoring fan-in, no
  reinforcement learning).
- **CI cadence wording** (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) — "every
  commit" → "every push and PR to `main`".
- **Eval harness honesty** (`scripts/eval/`, `apps/docs/docs/`) —
  removed "Macro F1" references, reframed the 200-incident synthetic
  dataset as substrate self-consistency, dropped the hardcoded
  `SUITES` constant, fixed the broken `--report` flag, and aligned
  Prophet usage in code and docs.

#### CI gates (P2)

- **No more `|| true`** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — removed every
  silent failure suppression.
- **Web Vitest smoke** — `apps/web` ships a Vitest suite covering
  marketplace filters, detection coverage view, and core layouts.
- **SDK + service jobs** — added Python pytest + Vitest jobs for
  `packages/sdk-{py,ts,go}` and `packages/plugin-sdk-{py,go}`, plus
  pytest jobs for `services/{api,agents,actions,connectors}`.
- **Detection + playbook validation in CI**
  (`.github/workflows/validate-detections.yml`,
  `.github/workflows/check-openapi.yml`) — `validate_detections.py`
  runs against all 6,913 rules and the OpenAPI spec is regenerated
  and compared on every PR.

#### DX (P3)

- **`aisoc-doctor` probes fixed** (`tools/aisoc-doctor/`) — checks
  match the actual ports, env var names, and service URLs.
- **CLI consistency** (`packages/cli/`, `README.md`,
  `apps/docs/docs/`) — `npx aisoc` and `aisoc` resolve identically;
  package names, missing pnpm scripts, and the `mcp` service
  reference are corrected; branching/tooling and env var names match
  across docs.
- **Infra READMEs** — `infra/k8s/`, `infra/helm/`, `infra/terraform/`,
  `infra/render/`, `infra/fly/`, `infra/railway/`, `infra/coolify/`
  each have a `README.md` documenting prerequisites, secrets, and
  invocation.

#### Detection scale + tiering (P4)

- **800 native rules** — added 600 new Sigma-shaped detections across
  five new spec modules (`scripts/detection_specs_part3_cloud.py`,
  `_identity.py`, `_endpoint.py`, `_network.py`,
  `_application.py`), each with `match_when`, MITRE tagging, and
  auto-generated positive/negative fixtures via
  `scripts/detection_specs_part3_helpers.py`. Native total:
  200 → **800**.
- **6,113 imported rules with provenance** — wired importers under
  `tools/detection_import/{sigma,splunk,chronicle,car}_importer.py`
  for SigmaHQ, Splunk Security Content, Chronicle, and MITRE CAR.
  Each imported rule is tagged with its source, license, and original
  ID; rules whose mappings cannot be replayed against AiSOC fixtures
  are quarantined under `detections/<source>-imports/quarantine/`
  (~5,937 quarantined, ~6,113 active).
- **Title → name migration** — imported YAMLs now use the canonical
  `name:` field instead of `title:`, matching `validate_detections.py`'s
  required schema. `tools/detection_import/common.py` was updated and
  6,113 existing files were migrated in place.
- **Marketplace tier UX** (`apps/web/src/components/marketplace/MarketplaceView.tsx`,
  `MarketplaceView.test.tsx`, `marketplace/index.json`,
  `apps/web/public/marketplace/index.json`,
  `scripts/build_marketplace.py`) — items now expose a `tier` field
  (`stable` / `beta` / `imported` / `community`), the marketplace UI
  defaults to `stable` and shows per-tier counts on filter chips,
  and `build_marketplace.py` infers tiers from `plugin.yaml` and
  source paths.
- **MITRE ATT&CK coverage view** (`apps/web/src/app/(app)/detection/coverage/`,
  `apps/web/src/lib/mitreTactics.ts`) — new in-app dashboard rendering
  the coverage matrix from the marketplace index.
- **Documentation refresh** — updated `README.md`,
  `apps/docs/docs/intro.md`, `apps/docs/docs/quickstart.md`,
  `apps/docs/docs/concepts/detections.md`,
  `apps/docs/docs/contributing/dev-setup.md`,
  `detections/README.md`, and `.github/workflows/validate-detections.yml`
  to reflect 800 native + ~6,000 imported (filterable by tier) and
  drop stale "200+ rules" claims.

#### Public demo on `tryaisoc.com`

- **Cloudflare Tunnel infra** (`infra/cloudflare/`) — `config.yml.example`,
  `tunnel.sh`, and a README explaining how to run the demo profile
  behind `tryaisoc.com` via `cloudflared`. Tunnel script reads
  `DOMAIN`, `TUNNEL_NAME`, `SUBDOMAINS`, `SKIP_DNS`, `SKIP_RUN` env
  vars; defaults publish apex + `api.`, `ws.`, `docs.` subdomains.
- **`pnpm demo:public` script** (`scripts/demo-public.sh`) — boots
  `docker-compose.demo.yml` (read-only demo profile with seeded
  incidents) via `pnpm aisoc:demo --no-open`, then brings up the
  Cloudflare Tunnel that maps `tryaisoc.com` → web (`:3000`),
  `api.tryaisoc.com` → api (`:8000`), `ws.tryaisoc.com` → realtime
  (`:4000`), and `docs.tryaisoc.com` → Docusaurus (`:3001`).
  Companion scripts: `pnpm demo:public:tunnel-only` (skip stack
  bring-up, just run the tunnel) and `pnpm demo:public:setup`
  (provision tunnel + DNS without running cloudflared, for
  `cloudflared service install` flows).
- **Public-host-agnostic web bundle** (`apps/web/next.config.js`,
  `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`) — the Next.js client now emits
  same-origin relative paths (`/api/v1/...`, `/ws/...`) instead of
  `localhost:8000`-baked URLs, with server-side rewrites proxying
  to api/agents/realtime by Docker DNS name. The same image works
  on `localhost:3000`, behind Cloudflare Tunnel on `tryaisoc.com`,
  or behind any reverse proxy without a rebuild.
- **README "Try it live"** — top-of-README link to the public demo
  with a one-liner for hosting your own on a Cloudflare-managed
  domain.

## [5.2.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added

This release groups four areas of work: an append-only investigation
ledger, a public eval harness, a mobile responder PWA, and a hosted
demo profile. Details below.

#### Auditable agent — Investigation Ledger

- **Investigation Ledger** (`services/api/migrations/008_investigation_ledger.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/investigation.py`,
  `services/agents/app/investigator/ledger.py`) — every prompt the agent
  emits, every tool call, every retrieved evidence shard, and every
  rationale is persisted as an append-only `investigation_step` row,
  scoped to a tenant + case.
- **Investigation Ledger UI** (`apps/web/src/components/cases/InvestigationLedger.tsx`)
  — replayable step-by-step view in the case workspace with prompt,
  response, and tool-call diffs.
- **`GET /api/v1/investigations/*` endpoints** (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/investigations.py`)
  for listing, retrieving, and replaying ledger entries by case.
- **Investigator graph upgrades**
  (`services/agents/app/investigator/{orchestrator,recon_agent,forensic_agent,responder_agent,report_writer_agent,state}.py`)
  — every node now writes a ledger entry on entry and exit, including
  the structured input it received and the structured output it produced.

#### Public eval harness — Pillar-1 eval suite

- **200-incident synthetic dataset**
  (`services/agents/tests/eval_data/synthetic_incidents.json`) — 200
  deterministic, regenerable cases covering all 14 MITRE ATT&CK enterprise
  tactics across roughly the top 50 techniques. Generated by
  `scripts/generate_eval_incidents.py`.
- **Four eval gates** under `services/agents/tests/`:
  - `test_alert_reduction.py` — **real measurement**: 1 000 noisy alerts →
    ~250 incidents via 3-tier fusion, with explicit storm and
    near-duplicate handling
  - `test_mitre_accuracy.py` — **substrate self-consistency gate**:
    tactic-level accuracy / precision / recall / F1 between the
    hand-curated extractor and the dataset that was written to feed it
  - `test_investigation_completeness.py` — **substrate self-consistency
    gate**: evidence-keyword coverage on a templated report
  - `test_response_quality.py` — **substrate self-consistency gate**:
    5-criterion offline rubric on a templated response plan (action class,
    severity awareness, MITRE alignment, evidence grounding, actionability)
- **`scripts/run_evals.py`** — one-shot harness with `--json` and `--ci`
  output modes. Total runtime ~25 ms on a laptop. CI-gated on every
  commit via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Runs deterministic substrate code
  against synthetic incidents — does not call the live LLM agent.
- **Public eval harness page** (`apps/docs/docs/benchmark.md`,
  `apps/web/src/app/benchmark/page.tsx`,
  `apps/web/src/components/benchmark/`) — published numbers, full
  method, comparison to other AI SOC offerings, and explicit framing of
  which suites measure substrate self-consistency vs real behaviour.
  Linked from the README and the docs landing page.

#### Mobile responder — Responder PWA

- **Responder PWA** (`apps/web/src/app/(responder)/`,
  `apps/web/src/components/responder/`,
  `apps/web/src/components/pwa/`) — installable, offline-aware, push-
  enabled responder console for on-call analysts. Service worker at
  `apps/web/public/sw.js`, manifest at `apps/web/public/manifest.json`,
  offline shell at `apps/web/public/offline.html`.
- **Passkey authentication** (`services/api/app/models/responder.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/passkeys.py`,
  `apps/web/src/lib/responder/`) — WebAuthn registration and login for
  the Responder surface; FIDO2 platform authenticators only, no SMS
  fallback.
- **On-call schedule + handoff** (`services/api/app/models/responder.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/oncall.py`) — current responder per
  tenant, surfaced in the Responder home page and in alert pages on the
  desktop console.
- **Approvals workflow** (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/approvals.py`)
  — long-lived approval requests for blast-radius-gated SOAR actions,
  approvable from the Responder PWA with hardware-attested passkey.
- **Web Push delivery** (`services/realtime/src/push.ts`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/push.py`) — VAPID-signed push
  notifications wired into the realtime gateway. Subscriptions persist
  per-device and follow the on-call rotation.
- **Migration** — `services/api/migrations/009_responder_pwa.sql`.

#### Ambient Copilot

- **Contextual actions** (`services/agents/app/api/contextual.py`,
  `apps/web/src/components/alerts/AlertDetailView.tsx`,
  `apps/web/src/components/cases/CaseWorkspace.tsx`,
  `apps/web/src/components/detections/RuleEditor.tsx`,
  `apps/web/src/components/playbooks/PlaybookEditor.tsx`) — the AI Copilot
  now reads the surface the analyst is standing on (alert / case / rule /
  playbook) and proposes the next two or three concrete actions with the
  correct payloads pre-filled. One click invokes the agent with the
  right tool.
- **Investigator graph awareness** — every contextual action is grounded
  in the same Investigation Ledger so the analyst sees, before clicking,
  which prompts and tool calls will be issued.

#### MCP server — first-class IDE / chat integration

- **`@aisoc/mcp`** (`services/mcp/`) — Model Context Protocol server
  exposing 11 AiSOC tools to Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cody, and Continue.
- **Discovery tools** — `aisoc_list_alerts`, `aisoc_list_cases`,
  `aisoc_query_detections`.
- **Deep-dive tools** — `aisoc_get_case`, `aisoc_get_investigation`,
  `aisoc_get_alert`.
- **Action / replay tools** — `aisoc_run_investigation`,
  `aisoc_replay_decision`, `aisoc_explain_step`, `aisoc_create_case`,
  `aisoc_assign_alert`. The replay set walks the Investigation Ledger
  step-by-step inside the IDE / chat.
- **Install command** — `npx -y @aisoc/mcp install --host claude --aisoc-url … --api-key …`.
- **Documentation** — `apps/docs/docs/integrations/mcp.md`,
  `services/mcp/README.md`.

#### Hosted demo — `pnpm aisoc:demo`

- **Slim demo profile** (`docker-compose.demo.yml`) — postgres + redis +
  kafka + api + agents + realtime + web. ClickHouse, OpenSearch, Neo4j,
  and Qdrant are gated behind compose profiles for production.
- **Prebuilt images** — `ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-{api,agents,realtime,web,…}`
  built and published by `.github/workflows/publish-images.yml` on every
  release tag.
- **One-shot orchestrator** (`scripts/aisoc-demo.ts`) — pulls images,
  brings up the stack, waits on healthchecks, seeds canonical demo data,
  kicks off an agent investigation against a seeded case, and opens the
  browser at `/cases/<uuid>` with the live ledger view selected.
- **Demo mode middleware** (`services/api/app/middleware/demo_mode.py`)
  — gates write operations, resets state every UTC midnight, and
  watermarks the UI as read-only. Tests at
  `services/api/tests/test_demo_mode.py`.
- **Target time-to-first-investigation:** roughly 3–5 minutes on a warm
  Docker daemon, depending on image cache state.
- **Cleanup** — `pnpm aisoc:demo:down` removes the volumes; logs at
  `pnpm aisoc:demo:logs`.

#### Deployment — one-click everywhere

- **Fly.io** (`infra/fly/`) — first-class config for `api`, `agents`,
  `realtime`, `web`. Deploys via `infra/fly/fly-demo-deploy.sh`,
  ~$14/mo for the whole stack.
- **Render** (`render.yaml`) — managed, sleep-on-idle
  config suitable for hobbyists and design partners.
- **Railway** (`infra/railway/railway.toml`) — pay-as-you-go PaaS.
- **Coolify** (`infra/coolify/README.md`) — self-hosted on your own VPS,
  reuses the existing `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Marketplace — content as code

- **~200 detection rules** in `detections/` covering MITRE ATT&CK
  Enterprise (cloud, identity, endpoint, network, application). Sigma
  format, with MITRE technique IDs in `tags`, fixtures under
  `detections/fixtures/`, and `detections/README.md` documenting the
  schema.
- **50+ response playbooks** in `playbooks/packs/v1/` — IAM, EDR,
  network, application, generic. JSON DSL with explicit decision trees,
  human-approval gates, and rollback steps. Schema in
  `playbooks/README.md`.
- **15 plugins** in `plugins/` — both Go and Python implementations for
  CrowdStrike, Splunk, Sentinel, AWS Security Hub, Okta, Cloudflare WAF,
  Defender, GuardDuty, Pagerduty, Slack, Teams, Jira, ServiceNow,
  VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB. Each ships with manifests, tests, and SDK
  helpers.
- **Marketplace index** (`marketplace/index.json`,
  `apps/web/public/marketplace/index.json`) — auto-generated by
  `scripts/build_marketplace.py` from the on-disk content tree.
- **Validation tooling** —
  - `scripts/validate_detections.py` (Sigma + MITRE ID schema)
  - `scripts/validate_playbooks.py` and `scripts/lint_playbooks.py`
    (DSL well-formedness + safety)
  - `.github/workflows/{validate-detections,validate-playbooks,sync-marketplace}.yml`
    enforce the gates on every PR.
- **In-app marketplace** (`apps/web/src/app/(app)/marketplace/page.tsx`,
  `apps/web/src/components/marketplace/MarketplaceView.tsx`) — filterable
  by category, ratings, verified vs community badge.

#### Plugin & client SDKs

- **`packages/plugin-sdk-go`** — Go plugin SDK
  (`module github.com/beenuar/aisoc/plugin-sdk-go`) with action,
  connector, enricher, registry, widget, and loader primitives.
  Examples under `packages/plugin-sdk-go/examples/`.
- **`packages/plugin-sdk-py`** — Python plugin SDK with the matching
  primitives, decorators, and a registry. Tests under
  `packages/plugin-sdk-py/tests/`.
- **`packages/sdk-py`** (PyPI: `aisoc-sdk`) — async Python client SDK
  for the AiSOC API.
- **`packages/sdk-ts`** (npm: `@aisoc/sdk`) — TypeScript client SDK
  with auto-generated types.
- **`packages/sdk-go`** — Go client SDK with OpenAPI-generated models.

#### Marketing & docs

- **`/why-open-source`** page (`apps/web/src/app/why-open-source/page.tsx`)
  — long-form description of the project's open-source posture and
  trade-offs.
- **Updated landing** (`apps/web/src/components/landing/{Hero,LandingNav,Footer,OpenSource}.tsx`)
  — the "live demo" button lands directly on a seeded investigation;
  comparison rows reference specific behaviours rather than generic
  claims.
- **Docusaurus refresh** — new MCP integration page, benchmark page,
  Investigation Ledger references, Responder PWA mentions in concepts
  and quickstart.

### Changed

- **Repository home** — all `cyble-inc/AiSOC` and `aisoc-os/aisoc` URLs
  updated to `beenuar/AiSOC` across docs, README, SDKs, and benchmark
  badges.
- **`packages/sdk-go` module path** is now `github.com/beenuar/aisoc/sdk-go`
  for the API client SDK; the plugin SDK is at
  `github.com/beenuar/aisoc/plugin-sdk-go`.
- **`alerts` API** (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/alerts.py`,
  `services/api/app/models/alert.py`) — surfaces copilot context
  (suggested next actions) inline on the alert detail response.
- **API router** (`services/api/app/api/v1/router.py`) — wires up
  `approvals`, `investigations`, `marketplace`, `oncall`, `passkeys`,
  `push`.

### Fixed

- **CI Docker build contexts** — `.github/workflows/{ci,release,publish-images}.yml`
  now set explicit `context` and `file` parameters per service; multi-
  service builds no longer race on a stale build root.
- **Docker Compose obsolete `version` warning** — removed `version: '3.8'`
  from `docker-compose.demo.yml`.
- **Repository hygiene** — added `.gocache/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`,
  `apps/docs/.docusaurus/`, `apps/docs/build/`,
  `plugins/**/*-build-test`, `plugins/**/*-build`,
  `eval_report.json`, and `eval_mitre_accuracy_report.json` to
  `.gitignore`. Removed previously tracked Docusaurus cache and local
  IDE hook state files from the index.
